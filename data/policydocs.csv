                                                          Preface
              Corruption seriously damages the fabric of society. It wrongly enriches criminals at
         the expense of public trust in institutions, creates an unlevel playing field for law-abiding
         businesses, and radically limits progress on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development
         Goals. Corruption, in all its forms, is a complex crime and through modern technology,
         criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to avoid detection. This makes
         it more important than ever for political leaders, policy makers, and law-enforcement
         authorities to develop joint approaches to stamping out such behaviours.
              By its very nature, corruption often occurs alongside or involves the commission of
         other serious financial crimes, be it money laundering, tax evasion, or terrorist financing.
         Combating corruption therefore requires a holistic approach that integrates a range of law
         enforcement efforts to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute financial and economic
         crimes associated with corrupt acts.
              In recent years, our understanding of the important links between different forms
         of financial crime has increased, leading jurisdictions around the globe to recognise
         the need for adopting more comprehensive cross-government approaches. This calls for
         a coordinated response from a range of government actors, including anti-corruption
         authorities, anti-money laundering authorities, financial intelligence units, tax authorities,
         customs authorities, financial regulators, police, and prosecutors, all of which may be
         involved at different stages of combating financial crimes.
              However, most jurisdictions continue to struggle with operationalising comprehensive
         government efforts to combat financial and economic crime. In this publication, the OECD
         and World Bank have joined forces to share their experience working with governments
         and agencies across the world in meeting this challenge. Recognising that tax authorities,
         especially, can be key allies in the fight against corruption, this joint OECD/World
         Bank report shines a spotlight on the legal, strategic, operational, and cultural aspects
         of co-operation between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities in investigating
         and prosecuting corruption and tax crimes. Drawing on data from 67 countries from all
         geographical regions, the report shows that, while most countries have laws in place to
         support co-operation, more work is needed to ensure that these laws are effective and well
         implemented. By enhancing inter-agency collaboration between tax authorities and anti-
         corruption authorities, governments will be better equipped to fight corruption and restore
         faith in public and private sector institutions.
              We invite leaders of both developed and developing countries to use this report
         to benchmark their governments’ co-operation frameworks and identify areas for
         improvement. Preventing, detecting, and punishing financial crimes like tax evasion and
         corruption requires collective action and the OECD and World Bank remain committed to
         supporting jurisdictions’ efforts. We must not let the advances made in building inclusive
         and fair societies be frustrated by these crimes. A sustained commitment to prioritise a

Introduction
         1.      Countries around the globe are facing a common threat posed by increasingly
         complex and innovative forms of financial crime. By exploiting modern technology and
         weaknesses in local legislation, criminals can now covertly move substantial sums between
         multiple jurisdictions with relative ease and great speed. As a consequence, criminal
         activity such as tax evasion, bribery and other forms of corruption are becoming ever more
         sophisticated. Meanwhile, law enforcement structures have, in many cases, not evolved at
         the same speed and the international community has struggled to keep up with this threat.
         2.      While viewed as distinct crimes, tax crime and corruption are often intrinsically
         linked, as criminals fail to report income derived from corrupt activities for tax purposes,
         or over-report in an attempt to launder the proceeds of corruption. A World Bank study
         of 25 000 firms in 57 countries found that firms that pay more bribes also evade more
         taxes. 1 More broadly, where corruption is prevalent in society, this can foster tax evasion.
         A recent IFC Enterprise Survey found that 13.3% of businesses globally report that “firms
         are expected to give gifts in meetings with tax officials”, with the frequency of this ranging
         across countries from nil to 62.6%. 2
         3.      The links between tax crime and corruption mean that tax authorities and
         law enforcement authorities can benefit greatly from more effective co-operation
         and sharing of information. Tax authorities hold a wealth of personal and company
         information such as income, assets, financial transactions and banking information, that
         can be a valuable source of intelligence to anti-corruption investigators. Similarly, anti-
         corruption authorities can provide tax administrations with important information about
         ongoing and completed corruption investigations that could assist a decision to reopen a tax
         assessment, initiate a tax crime investigation, or more generally promote integrity among
         tax officials. The investigation into Brazilian majority-state-owned oil company, Petrobras,
         initiated in 2014, is a prime example of this. Civil tax auditors played a critical role in this
         transnational corruption investigation by analysing suspects’ tax and customs data and
         sharing this with the police and public prosecutor as permitted by law. As a result, officials
         were able to uncover evidence of money laundering, tax evasion, and hidden assets, and
         to track financial flows. While criminal investigations and prosecutions are still ongoing,
         as of August 2018, the operation has resulted in dozens of charges against high profile
         public officials and politicians and billions of dollars in criminal fines, tax penalties, and
         recovered assets.
         4.      However, there remains significant room for improvement in co-operation
         between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities. Despite success stories, anecdotal

"15","14 – 1. Introduction and key findings
           evidence provided by many jurisdictions involved in this report suggests that reporting
           and information sharing between authorities often occurs on ad-hoc basis rather than
           systematically. This is reinforced by the OECD’s 2017 study on the Detection of Foreign
           Bribery, which provides that only 2% of concluded foreign bribery cases between 1999 and
           2017 were detected by tax authorities. 3
           5.      These issues are at the heart of the current global agenda. In 2015, the
           United Nations agreed 17 Sustainable Development Goals, including a specific target
           of substantially reducing corruption in all of its forms. 4 The World Bank and OECD
           strongly support these goals and recognise the importance of dealing with corruption and
           tax evasion at a policy and technical level. In this context, for many years, international
           organisations including the OECD and World Bank have been active in supporting
           countries to strengthen their legal and institutional frameworks for the prevention,
           detection, investigation, and prosecution of tax crime and corruption, and the recovery of
           the proceeds of these crimes. In 2012, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recognised
           these links by including corruption, bribery, and tax crimes in the list of designated
           predicate offences for money laundering purposes in its International Standards on
           Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation. 5
           6.      In 2009 6 and 2010 7, the OECD issued two Council Recommendations calling for
           greater co-operation and better information sharing between different government agencies
           involved in combating financial crimes. These are supported by the Oslo Dialogue, an
           initiative which encourages a whole of government approach to tackling all forms of
           financial crime. 8 As part of this initiative, in 2017, the OECD published its third edition of
           Effective Inter-Agency Co-operation in Fighting Tax Crimes and Other Financial Crimes
           (the Rome Report) which analyses the legal gateways and mechanisms for inter-agency
           co-operation between authorities responsible for investigating tax and other financial
           crimes. At the same time, the OECD published Ten Global Principles for Fighting Tax
           Crime, the first report of its kind which allows countries to benchmark their legal and
           operational frameworks for tackling tax crime, and identify areas where improvements
           can be made.
           7.      The OECD continues to advance practical tools and training to combat tax crime
           and corruption. OECD Handbooks on Money Laundering Awareness and Bribery and
           Corruption Awareness provide practical guidance to help tax officials identify indicators
           of possible criminal activity in the course of their work. In 2013, the OECD International
           Academy for Tax Crime Investigation was launched in co-operation with Italy’s Guardia
           di Finanza to strengthen developing countries’ capacity to tackle illicit financial flows. In
           2017, a sister Academy was piloted in Kenya and will be formally launched in Nairobi, in
           late 2018. In July 2018, OECD and Argentina’s Federal Administration of Public Revenue
           (AFIP) signed a MoU to establish a Latin American centre of the OECD Academy in
           Buenos Aires, Argentina, with the first programme planned for late 2018.
           8.      The World Bank is also helping strengthen developing countries’ capacity to stem
           tax evasion. In 2015, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) launched
           the Joint Initiative to Support Developing Countries in Strengthening Tax Systems to give
           greater voice to developing countries in the global debate on tax issues. 9 Through this
           joint initiative, the World Bank and the IMF are assembling a set of tools and guidance
           aimed at addressing developing economy needs. As part of this work, the World Bank has
           also partnered with the governments of Norway and Denmark to launch the Tax Evasion
           Initiative to enable enforcement agencies in developing countries to more effectively
           combat tax crimes and other financial crimes. Under the Tax Evasion Initiative, the World

         Bank is developing a set of tools, including a handbook on tax evasion schemes and
         red flags for tax investigators and auditors, as well as a methodology for assessing the
         performance of criminal tax investigation units which is currently being piloted.
         9.      In researching, developing, and publishing this joint report on the legal, strategic,
         and operational aspects of co-operation between tax authorities and anti-corruption
         authorities, the World Bank and OECD aim to complement their existing work and advance
         the shared objective of improving the capacity of all countries to effectively combat
         financial crime.
Overview of the joint OECD/World Bank report
         10. This joint report by the World Bank and OECD identifies building blocks for
         more effective co-operation and is the first comprehensive global study of its kind.
         The report identifies key agencies involved in the fight against tax crime and corruption
         and examines the organisational models applied to these agencies in different countries.
         Reflecting on this, the report examines the obligations on personnel in each authority
         to report suspicions of tax crime or corruption that they come across in the course of
         their normal activities, as well as the extent to which legal gateways are in place for
         tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities to share information. The report also
         explores practical ways in which countries facilitate other forms of co-operation between
         authorities engaged in combating tax crime and corruption, including through joint and
         parallel investigations, joint taskforces, joint intelligence centres, targeted training, and
         staff secondments. The report articulates the importance of effective co-operation and the
         benefits that this can bring to tax administrations, tax crime investigation authorities, and
         corruption investigation authorities, within the context of their country’s specific legal and
         operational framework. It also recognises potential challenges to effective co-operation and
         examines how these may be addressed based on the experience of countries.
         11. The content of the report is based on responses from 67 countries to a survey,
         which examined the organisational structure for investigating and prosecuting tax crime
         and corruption, as well as models for, and the experience of, inter-agency co-operation
         in fighting these crimes. 10 The survey was sent to a diverse cross-section of developed
         and developing countries from all geographic regions and all countries that responded to
         the survey were included in the report. These countries represent a broad geographical
         spread and vary greatly in their levels of economic development and experience of inter-
         agency co-operation to combat complex, financial crime. These survey responses were
         supplemented by follow-up questions and telephone interviews with experts from specific
         countries. This information has been analysed under a number of different headings, set out
         in the following chapters, in order to understand the spread of practices between countries,
         the benefits these provide, and the challenges they pose. This analysis is presented using a
         combination of tables, charts, and narrative description. In addition, two countries, which
         were not able to provide responses to the survey, provided case studies demonstrating
         inter-agency co-operation between their tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities that
         have been included in the report. Initial outcomes were discussed at a roundtable during
         the fifth OECD Forum on Tax and Crime, hosted by HM Revenue and Customs in London,
         in November 2017, which was attended by over 212 delegates from 60 countries and eight
         international organisations. These discussions have been fed into the final report, and the
         input from many jurisdictions attending that event is also reflected. The information in this
         report is current as of August 2018.

"17","16 – 1. Introduction and key findings
           12. The report will enable authorities to review and evaluate their own approaches and
           structures for co-operation relative to those in other countries, and identify opportunities
           for making improvements based on practices that have been used successfully elsewhere. 11
           However, it does not propose a “one size fits all” solution. Countries differ in many ways,
           including in terms of their tax and legal systems, their size and population, the structure
           of agencies responsible for administering taxes and investigating crime, overall rates of
           compliance, and the existence of other enforcement strategies (such as administrative
           penalties). The systems that countries need to facilitate co-operation between tax
           authorities and anti-corruption authorities are directly influenced by the legal and
           operational frameworks they apply to combat tax crime and corruption. These, in turn,
           reflect countries’ broader legal, institutional, and cultural environments. Each country
           must identify and implement a framework for inter-agency co-operation that is consistent
           with its domestic context, its obligations under international standards and conventions
           and, in the case of European Union Member States, European Union law.
           13. For the purposes of this report, tax crime and corruption are defined broadly.
           References to “tax crime” mean all criminal offences concerning the administration or
           payment of taxes, including violations of income tax laws and indirect tax obligations (such
           as Value Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Service Tax (GST)). References to “corruption”
           mean all offences set out in Chapter III of the United Nations Convention Against
           Corruption (UNCAC), 12 including the bribery of domestic and foreign public officials in
           the public and private sectors, embezzlement, misappropriation of property by a public
           official, trading in influence, abuse of functions, and illicit enrichment.
Key findings
           14. An examination of the co-operation frameworks in place in each country led to a
           number of key findings:
                    I. Effective inter-agency co-operation begins with a robust and clearly
                        defined institutional framework. This does not imply there is a single correct
                        approach to how a country should structure its authorities with responsibility
                        for administering taxes or combating tax crime and corruption. However,
                        whatever model is adopted should be implemented in a way that provides
                        a clear allocation of responsibilities and defined governance arrangements
                        (e.g. decision-making responsibility, accountability, and supervision), thus
                        reducing the risk of duplication of efforts and gaps in enforcement.
                    II. Co-operation between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities is
                        an essential element of the whole-of-government approach to tackling
                        financial crime. The work of tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities is
                        fundamentally linked. Tax crime and corruption often occur together and so
                        either authority may uncover indications of misconduct that should be reported
                        to the other for possible assessment or investigation. In addition, in the course
                        of their work, tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities collect and hold
                        information that may be directly relevant to the work of other authorities.
                        Legal gateways can be established to support the sharing of this information,
                        subject to suitable safeguards. By fully exploiting the areas in which authorities
                        can enhance and support each other’s work, countries could gain significant
                        benefits in terms of detecting, investigating, prosecuting, understanding, and
                        deterring tax crime and corruption, and economic crime more broadly.

                  III. Countries are encouraged to consider the extent to which legal, operational,
                        or cultural/political challenges are undermining effective co-operation. The
                        lack of a legal basis for co-operation or undue legal restrictions on co-operation
                        – such as laws that prohibit or impose excessive burdens on the sharing of
                        information – present a fundamental challenge and are inconsistent with a
                        whole-of-government approach to combating financial crime. Operational
                        frameworks are ineffective without streamlined and efficient procedures for
                        obtaining information, awareness on the part of one authority about the types of
                        information held by the other, and training for officials on information sharing
                        gateways. In addition, such processes should also be supported by a culture
                        of co-operation. This can be difficult to establish, particularly in the absence
                        of trust, political support, or where there are concerns around the political
                        independence of either agency. Co-operation may also be hampered where
                        an agency lacks the backing of senior leadership or takes a narrow view of its
                        mandate with respect to combating economic crime.
                  IV. Countries should consider a range of mechanisms to increase instances
                        of information sharing between their tax authorities and anti-corruption
                        authorities. The majority of countries in this report have mechanisms in place
                        to support the reporting of suspected crime and the sharing of information
                        between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities. Nonetheless, restrictions
                        or limits on reporting and information sharing still exist and reported instances
                        of both remain low in many countries. To facilitate increased information
                        sharing, countries should consider making a range of legal gateways available
                        and implement systems to ensure that these are operational. This may include
                        having identifiable contact points within each agency and ensuring that key
                        individuals within each agency have a clear understanding of the types of
                        information and powers the other agencies possess. Finally, regardless of the
                        legal gateway or combination of legal gateways available in a given country, it
                        is critical that countries have safeguards in place to protect the confidentiality
                        of the information they hold and the integrity of the work carried out by
                        other agencies. This will often require clear parameters on who can access
                        information and for what purpose, as well as having defined governance
                        mechanisms to ensure that information is used for its intended purpose.
                  V. It is important that tax examiners and auditors can detect corruption red
                        flags and that corruption investigators can identify indicators of tax crime.
                        Training in this area is important and can be highly effective and efficient
                        because it enables increased detection of tax crime and corruption simply
                        by utilising the established roles of tax and anti-corruption officials and the
                        information already available to them. This report provides guidance on the
                        actual indicators that officials would be likely to come across in the course of
                        their ordinary activities. Such indicators may arise in the context of assessing
                        a subject’s external and internal risk environment, transactions, payments
                        and money flows, and outcomes of transactions. Countries are encouraged to
                        consider including training on these matters as part of the core curriculum for
                        tax examiners/auditors, tax crime investigators, and corruption investigators.
                  VI. Countries have experienced positive results from the use of joint operations
                        and taskforces that involve tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities.
                        These benefits could be replicated in other countries. The role of joint
                        operations and taskforces is growing as more enforcement authorities grapple

                       with the increasing complexity of economic crime and the particular interplay
                       between tax crime and corruption. They are an efficient and effective means of
                       co-operation and have versatile application to a range of issues connected to tax
                       crime and corruption. The benefits of joint operations and taskforces include
                       increased enforcement capacity, a broader set of investigative powers and tools,
                       ability to share resources, de-confliction of enforcement action, undertaking
                       simultaneous action, enhancing information sharing, and increasing deterrence.
                   VII.      Parallel investigations, co-ordination fora, and joint intelligence
                       centres, are important mechanisms to enhance information sharing and
                       other forms of co-operation. Well co-ordinated parallel investigations can
                       greatly enhance co-operation between tax authorities and anti-corruption
                       authorities. Countries have also developed a range of different types of
                       co-ordination fora to bring together tax authorities, anti-corruption authorities,
                       and others, at regular intervals for structured analysis or discussions on issues
                       to advance a shared objective. These fora may be used for a variety of purposes,
                       such as to develop inter-agency crime fighting strategies, assess threats, detect
                       misconduct, co-ordinate cases, or distil lessons from past investigations. Joint
                       intelligence centres are a related but different mechanism that collect, store,
                       and analyse information, and co-ordinate the sharing of information between
                       agencies. By centralising the function of data analysis, joint intelligence centres
                       can look across a wider spectrum of financial crime data than individual
                       authorities acting on their own, and can more easily identify trends or
                       individual cases where corruption and tax crime overlap.
                   VIII.     Other mechanisms include staff secondments, automatic review of
                       the tax affairs of persons sanctioned for corruption, and income and asset
                       registers can also support co-operation between tax authorities and anti-
                       corruption authorities. Secondments and the co-location of personnel can
                       improve working arrangements between anti-corruption and tax authorities.
                       This strategy enhances other forms of co-operation by improving the ability
                       of the seconded individual to identify opportunities for co-operation and to
                       develop personal contacts, which can be used to further develop co-operation
                       in future. By reviewing the tax affairs of persons sanctioned for corruption,
                       a tax authority can complement the work of the anti-corruption authority
                       and may also detect tax evasion that is connected to corruption offences.
                       Finally, registers of the income and assets of public officials are an important
                       centralised tool that may contain information useful for investigations
                       conducted by either authority.

"22","                2. Institutional frameworks for the investigation and prosecution of tax crime and corruption – 21
                                                         Chapter 2
           Institutional frameworks for the investigation and prosecution of
                                           tax crime and corruption
         15. This chapter focuses on the institutional models countries use for the investigation
         and prosecution of tax crime and corruption. The model or models adopted in a particular
         jurisdiction typically reflect its history, legal system, and general law enforcement
         framework. The number and type of agencies will directly impact the processes and
         agreements required to facilitate effective enforcement.
         16. Several agencies are typically involved in the administration of taxes, the
         prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of tax crime and corruption, and the
         recovery of the proceeds of these crimes. These include the tax administration, general
         law enforcement bodies such as the police 1 and public prosecution authority, and agencies
         with a specific mandate to combat tax crime and corruption. The agency competent to
         investigate a particular offence may depend on the geographical region in which the
         suspected crime was committed, the type of person involved (e.g. government official vs
         member of the public), and the nature of the suspected crime.
         17. A whole-of-government approach requires a well-functioning institutional
         framework. The involvement of multiple agencies in civil inquiries, criminal
         investigations, and the prosecution of tax crimes and corruption increases transaction
         costs and necessitates effective co-ordination. Cross-agency co-ordination should be led
         by a central government agency or, at a minimum, be a co-ordinated effort among relevant
         agencies to address issues as they arise. In line with Principle 5 of the OECD’s Ten Global
         Principles for Fighting Tax Crime 2, a clear definition of institutional responsibilities
         is a precondition for effective co-operation among tax authorities and anti-corruption
         enforcement bodies.
         18. Individual agencies should take into account the institutional landscape.
         The need for co-ordination is particularly present in countries where multiple agencies
         are involved in tax crime and corruption cases or where the prevalence of tax crime or
         corruption is high. In either situation, the individual enforcement bodies would be well-
         served by assessing the institutional landscape from its particular vantage point by:
              •     Understanding the benefits of co-operation. Having a clear understanding of
                    the objectives and benefits of better inter-agency co-operation helps ensure line
                    of sight between co-ordination activities and results. Potential benefits include:
                    ensuring that the possibility of tax non-compliance is explored in all corruption
                    cases and vice-versa pursuing possible corruption in cases involving civil tax
                    breaches; addressing complex cases through more joint or parallel investigations;
                    conducting more robust threat assessments; improving conviction rates; sharing
                    business intelligence; and contributing to legislative improvements to combat tax
                    crime and corruption.

              •    Engaging the relevant units within a particular agency. This report focuses on
                   co-operation between agencies, but agencies also need to have arrangements in
                   place to ensure they co-operate effectively internally. Where a centralised unit is
                   responsible for co‑ordinating co-operation with other agencies, officials within
                   this unit should have a good understanding of its key role in the fight against tax
                   crime and corruption, any obligations for co-operation that exist, and the benefits
                   of co-operation, particularly where discretion may be applied. They should also
                   have a good understanding of areas within their agency where relevant information
                   may be held and the importance of a swift response to a request for co-operation;
                   take an active role in encouraging other areas within their agency to support greater
                   inter-agency co-operation; and engage with these areas to understand cases where
                   they may benefit from co-operation with other agencies to ensure this co-operation
                   is reciprocal, within the limits permitted by law.
              •    Taking stock of existing co-operation arrangements. Tax and anti-corruption
                   agencies should regularly take stock of their collaborative arrangements as
                   determined by laws, formal agreements, and informal arrangements, in order to
                   determine their fitness for purpose.
          19. The institutional frameworks described in this chapter are only intended to reflect
          the general practice within a country. Many countries’ frameworks for the investigation
          and prosecution of tax crime and corruption will have particular features, some of which
          are detailed in examples. A more comprehensive examination of countries’ enforcement
          frameworks can be found in the latest edition of the OECD Report on Effective Inter-Agency
          Co-operation in Fighting Tax Crimes and Other Financial Crimes (the Rome Report).
General institutional frameworks for investigating tax crime
          20. The tax administration is responsible for investigating tax crime in 42 countries. 3
          A country’s tax administration is responsible for the assessment and collection of taxes on
          behalf of the government. This involves gathering and processing information on individuals
          and corporations that are liable to pay taxes, including personal details, property ownership,
          investments, financial transactions, and business operations. Tax administrations employ large
          numbers of trained specialists and investigators with experience in auditing and analysing
          financial data and investigating suspicious or anomalous transactions. Tax administrations

                                                                   5

                                                                                     tax administration

         often have extensive powers to access information and documentation from taxpayers and third
         parties and are thus well placed to play a central role in the prevention and detection of both tax
         crime and corruption.
              •     In 30 countries, including all common law countries included in this report, the
                    tax administration has responsibility for both conducting and directing tax crime
                    investigations. 4
              •     In 15 countries, tax crime investigations are conducted by the tax administration
                    and directed by a public prosecutor (or, in the case of Spain, an examining judge). 5
                    In El Salvador, some cases are conducted by the police with support from the tax
                    administration, but are still led by the public prosecutor.
              •     Germany and the United States are included in both frameworks as their respective
                    prosecution authorities and tax administrations may both investigate tax crime. In
                    Germany, investigations are typically conducted by the tax investigation unit of the
                    respective Land’s tax administration, under the direction of a public prosecutor.
                    However, the office for administrative fines and criminal matters, which is part of the
                    tax investigation unit, can conduct certain tax-related criminal investigations directly.
                    The United States, on the other hand, has two types of criminal investigation:
                    investigations conducted and directed by the tax administration and grand jury
                    investigations where the prosecutor initiates and directs the tax administration’s
                    investigation.
         21. Agencies outside of the tax administration are empowered to conduct tax crime
         investigations in 28 countries, including the majority of civil law jurisdictions. 6
              •     Five countries applying this model have specialist tax investigation agencies 7
                    (e.g. Investigation Service of the Ministry of Finance of Georgia 8 and Greece’s
                    YEDDE under the Independent Authority of Public Revenue).
              •     In the vast majority of countries that apply this model (26 in total) tax crime
                    investigations are conducted by the police under the direction of a public prosecutor
                    (or, in the case of Chile and Colombia, by the public prosecutor directly). 9
              •     Ghana, Greece, and Iceland are included in each of these lists as both specialist tax
                    agencies and the police may conduct tax crime investigations. For example, while
                    specialist agencies outside of the tax administration conduct most investigations,
                    in Ghana the national police still has broad investigative powers which cover
                    tax crimes and in Iceland the police can conduct independent investigations into
                    serious tax crimes.
         22. Five countries apply a hybrid model whereby tax crime investigations can take
         place both within and outside of the tax administration. 10 Five countries have been
         included under both of the above institutional frameworks, as they apply hybrid
         models whereby both the tax administration and external agencies (e.g. police) may
         conduct tax crime investigations. In Paraguay, Spain, and Sweden, in addition to the
         police, investigations may in some instances be conducted by the tax administration under
         the direction of an examining judge or public prosecutor. In Rwanda, the Revenue Authority
         exercises judicial police powers to investigate tax offences, though the Rwanda Investigation
         Bureau (an independent body under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice) and the
         National Public Prosecution Authority (NPPA) are also empowered to conduct investigations.
         In Greece, tax crime investigations may be undertaken by the revenue authority or the
         YEDDE.

"25","24 – 2. Institutional frameworks for the investigation and prosecution of tax crime and corruption
          23. Italy is not included in the above models. Tax crime is investigated by the Guardia di
          Finanza (military police) both independently and under the direction of the public prosecutor.
General institutional frameworks for investigating corruption
          24. There is greater diversity in the models for investigation of corruption than
          for the investigation of tax crime. A country’s framework for tackling corruption can
          include a broad range of tools to promote integrity, transparency, and accountability,
          and to deter and punish corrupt misconduct in the public and private sectors, both
          domestically and internationally. This section focuses primarily on countries’ frameworks
          for the investigation of corruption, which can take many forms and involve multiple
          stakeholders across all branches and levels of government (e.g. elected officials, judges,
          police, prosecutors, dedicated anti-corruption authorities, corporate regulators, auditors,
          comptrollers, and ombudsmen). As with tax crime, the agencies responsible for corruption
          investigations will differ between countries and many jurisdictions will have multiple,
          overlapping competent authorities. In this situation, decisions on which authority will
          conduct an investigation may be based on a range of factors such as location (e.g. crimes
          committed in a particular region), the nature of the crime (e.g. foreign versus domestic
          bribery), the identity of the suspect (e.g. corruption by public officials), or entirely practical
          considerations (e.g. who detected evidence of a possible crime).
          25. A public prosecutor or an examining judge either directs, supervises, or participates
          in the investigation of corruption offences in 50 countries. This typically reflects the general
          structure of law enforcement in these countries, which are mostly civil law jurisdictions. 11
          26. In 46 countries, the police (often through a specialist anti-corruption unit)
          conduct corruption investigations. 12 In some cases, there may be more than one authority
          conducting investigations. For example, In Indonesia, the Attorney General’s Office (AGO)
          and the police are responsible for investigating corruption. However, top-level corruption is
          investigated by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) – which also has the power
          to supervise and take over the AGO’s investigations. Similarly, in Norway, corruption
          cases are investigated by the police under the supervision of the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
          However, the most serious and complex corruption cases are investigated and prosecuted
          at ØKOKRIM, which is the national authority for the investigation and prosecution of
          economic and environmental crime.

         27. For the purposes of this model, no distinction is made between countries where
         police can conduct entire investigations autonomously (e.g. Australia, Finland, and South
         Africa) or where they require external supervision. However, where countries are listed
         under the above two models, investigations are typically conducted by the police under
         the direction or supervision of a public prosecutor or examining judge (e.g. Angola, Brazil,
         and Madagascar). The report also does not distinguish between countries where the police
         are the main corruption investigation body (e.g. the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and
         those where police can conduct investigations but are not the primary investigative body
         (e.g. Singapore, where the independent Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) has
         primary authority over corruption investigations).
         28. In ten countries, a specialist agency under the Ministry of the Interior conducts
         corruption investigations. 13 Examples include New Zealand’s Serious Fraud Office
         (SFO) which is mandated to investigate and prosecute serious and complex fraud
         and corruption, Kenya’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission which investigates
         corruption and economic crimes and makes recommendations on prosecutions, and
         Austria’s Federal Bureau of Anti-Corruption. Even where countries have a specialist unit,
         other agencies may still play a key role in the investigation of corruption. For example,
         in the United Kingdom, the SFO is responsible for all serious and complex fraud cases,
         including foreign bribery. However, the National Crime Agency also has a wide remit to
         tackle serious and organised crime, including corruption, and the City of London Police,
         Metropolitan Police Service, Ministry of Defence Police, and Territorial police forces (all
         of which sit under Model 2) are also responsible for corruption investigations within their
         jurisdictions.
         29. Seven countries have specialist anti-corruption bodies established under the
         Ministry of Finance that can investigate corruption. 14 Bodies are set up in this way
         for a variety of reasons. In Costa Rica, the Department of Internal Affairs investigates
         corruption by Ministry officials, whereas the Investigation Service of the Ministry of
         Finance of Georgia investigates corruption where it arises in the private sector and the
         Financial Investigation Service detects the crime.
         30. In 24 countries, specialist agencies independent of any ministry conduct corruption
         investigations. 15 Reflecting the importance and widespread nature of corruption,
         these agencies typically report directly to the Office of the President, Prime Minister,
         Cabinet, Parliament, or similar. Again, such agencies can take on a variety of forms and
         functions. In Burkina Faso, the Higher Authority for State Control and Anti-Corruption is
         responsible for (among other things) conducting investigations into corruption and related
         offences within public bodies. It is attached to the Office of the Prime Minister and a
         dedicated budget guarantees its financial independence. Similarly, India’s Central Vigilance
         Commission is an independent federal government body which investigates suspected
         corruption by certain categories of public servants, including high level public officials. In
         Singapore, the CPIB is the sole and independent law enforcement agency responsible for
         investigating offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Its director reports to the
         Prime Minister and while it is housed within the Prime Minister’s Office, it operates with
         functional independence. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), created
         in 2015,specialises in investigating corruption committed by senior officials.
         31. Eleven countries also have authorities that can impose administrative penalties
         in corruption cases. 16 All of the above models concern criminal investigation authorities
         capable of conducting corruption investigations. In addition, eleven countries
         provided information on financial regulators and other authorities which are able to

          conduct non-criminal investigations into certain categories of corruption, and impose
          administrative fines or other sanctions. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange
          Commission (SEC) has a specialised unit responsible for civil enforcement of the Foreign
          Corrupt Practices Act over certain classes of companies and their officers, directors,
          employees, agents, or stockholders acting on the issuer’s behalf. In Brazil and Colombia the
          Offices of the Comptroller General and Superintendence of Companies respectively may
          bring administrative proceedings against legal persons for corrupt misconduct.
Prosecuting tax crime and corruption
          (i) Institutional frameworks
          32. The prosecution authority is the government agency that represents the state before
          the courts in prosecutions of criminal offences. This report identifies general themes
          among countries’ institutional frameworks for the prosecution of tax crime and corruption.
          As with the above section on the investigation of tax crime and corruption, these are broad
          categories and exceptions will necessarily exist within countries.

                                                                                  responsible for criminal investigations
                 Note: Some countries apply more than one model.
          33. Forty-six countries have a central prosecution authority that is also responsible for
          criminal investigations (including almost all civil law countries included in the report). In
          these countries, tax crime and corruption prosecutions are conducted by a public prosecutor
          or, in some cases, an examining judge, who also supervises or controls the investigation
          of these crimes. 17 In many of these countries, the police are referred to as “judicial police”
          when acting as agents of a prosecution or judicial authority. In some jurisdictions, the public
          prosecutor is only involved in the early stages of investigations into very serious offences.
          In Burkina Faso, criminal investigations are instigated by the public prosecutor but led by
          an examining judge. In Mexico, responsibility for conducting investigations lies with the
          Attorney-General, who exercises this function through the Federal Agency of Investigation
          and a number of specialist units. In Moldova, the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office leads
          all criminal investigations conducted by the National Anti-Corruption Centre, though it
          can also conduct its own criminal investigations. In Ukraine, NABU directs investigations
          conducted by its detectives in the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office.

"28","                2. Institutional frameworks for the investigation and prosecution of tax crime and corruption – 27
         34. In a further 17 countries, including most common law countries, public prosecutors
         and judges are not directly involved in criminal investigations. 18 However, they may take
         on an advisory role with respect to matters of procedure and evidence. Under this model,
         investigations are conducted by the police or a specialised agency (e.g. tax administration
         or dedicated anti-corruption body) and then forwarded to a central prosecution authority
         for review. The prosecution agency may typically either proceed with a prosecution, refer
         the case back to the investigating agency for further evidence, or refuse to prosecute.
         Countries applying this model should seek to involve the prosecution service in financial
         investigations from an early stage to ensure that due process is followed and sufficient
         evidence is collected to proceed to prosecution. Ongoing and frequent consultation between
         investigative and prosecutorial bodies can increase the chances of a successful prosecution.
         35. In seven countries, law enforcement agencies may prosecute offences directly. 19
         This model is closely related to the above model where the central prosecution has an
         investigative role. However, in addition to a central prosecution authority, other law
         enforcement agencies (e.g. police, tax administration, or anti-corruption authority) may
         conduct criminal prosecutions directly. For example, in New Zealand the Inland Revenue
         Department and SFO are responsible for the investigation and prosecution of tax crime
         and serious fraud (including corruption) respectively. In Nigeria, the Independent Corrupt
         Practices and Other Related Offences Commission and the Economic and Financial Crimes
         Commission (both of which report to Parliament) are able to independently prosecute
         corruption offences without the involvement of the Attorney General.
         36. Each prosecution model offers different advantages and disadvantages. In
         jurisdictions where law enforcement authorities can prosecute crimes directly, agencies
         will develop a high degree of specialist skills with respect to offences within their purview
         which enables prosecutions to be conducted by experts in a particular area of criminal
         law. By controlling their own prosecutions, agencies also benefit from greater decision-
         making autonomy and flexibility in setting their strategic direction, and have less direct
         competition for resources. However, this model does increase the potential that resources
         will be duplicated as each agency maintains its independent prosecution structure. There
         is also the risk of inconsistency in approach between agencies and the possibility that
         important cases may not be pursued based on the priorities of a particular agency that
         does not consider implications for the enforcement of economic crimes more generally.
         Conversely, jurisdictions with a central prosecution agency will see less duplication and
         may have greater flexibility to prioritise and combine charges as appropriate (e.g. it may
         be easier for a central authority to combine charges for tax evasion, bribery, and money
         laundering into a single prosecution than it is for a jurisdiction where different agencies are
         responsible for prosecuting these crimes). Hybrid models: Some countries where the central
         prosecution authority is generally responsible for prosecuting tax crime and corruption also
         have exceptions whereby certain law enforcement agencies may prosecute these crimes
         directly. For example, in Rwanda, the NPPA prosecutes all cases of corruption investigated
         by the Rwanda Investigation Bureau, but the Office of the Ombudsman can independently
         prosecute cases of corruption that it investigates without involving the NPPA. In Ghana and
         Malaysia, the Attorney-General’s office may grant law enforcement agencies, including the
         tax administration, the power to prosecute cases they have investigated. In Germany, the 16
         Länder (regions) have responsibility for prosecuting all tax and corruption offences while in
         the United Kingdom, serious financial crimes may be prosecuted by the SFO.

"29","28 – 2. Institutional frameworks for the investigation and prosecution of tax crime and corruption
          (ii) Specialisation of prosecutors 20
          37. The specialisation of prosecutors is a natural consequence of a legal system
          where tax administrations and specialised anti-corruption bodies are able to conduct
          their own prosecutions. However, this is not the only way that countries can ensure their
          prosecutors have sufficient expertise to prosecute complex financial offences like tax crime
          and corruption. Forms of specialisation will vary between countries, and there is no single
          “best practice” to achieve this. An analysis of the 65 countries that provided information
          on the specialisation of prosecutors for tax crimes and corruption revealed some common
          themes among countries’ institutional frameworks. Approximately 84% of countries have
          prosecutors that are either specialised in tax crime, corruption, and/or economic and
          financial crimes more generally. Several countries fall within more than one model and
          examples of why this may occur are provided below.
                             Figure 2.4. Number of countries with specialised prosecutors

                                                                                  Prosecutors specialised in
                                                                              economic and financial crime
                        Note: Some countries apply more than one model.
          38. General prosecutors handle prosecutions for tax crime and corruption in
          20 countries. 21 The term “general prosecutors” refers to the fact that they are competent to
          prosecute all or a broad range of criminal offences including non-financial crimes. Nine of
          these countries fall within more than one model, meaning that some, but not all, prosecutors
          responsible for tax crime and corruption have a degree of specialisation.
          39. In 29 countries, prosecutors specialised in economic and financial crime are
          responsible for tax crime and corruption cases. 22 In Georgia, Paraguay, and Turkey, tax
          crime and corruption are the responsibility of specialised economic crime units within the
          central prosecution office.
          40. In a further 29 countries, prosecutors are specialised in tax crime and/or
          corruption. 23 This includes all six countries whose law enforcement agencies are
          competent to prosecute these offences directly (e.g. Azerbaijan, Bhutan, and Malaysia,
          where the tax administration may prosecute tax crime directly). This model also captures
          a range of other countries that have specialised prosecutors. These prosecutors may have a
          dedicated unit within a central prosecution body or an agency specialised in the prosecution
          of some forms of tax crime and corruption. For example, in Sweden, prosecutors specialising
          in tax crime sit within the Swedish Economic Crime Authority and prosecutors specialising
          in corruption sit within the central prosecution body. Singapore’s central tax authority

         has dedicated tax crime prosecutors, but important cases may also be carried out by the
         Attorney-General’s Chambers which is also responsible for all corruption prosecutions (and
         has dedicated anti-corruption prosecutors for this purpose). Malaysia seconds deputy public
         prosecutors from its Attorney-General Chambers to the Anti-Corruption Commission.
         41. Several countries fall within more than one model for a range of reasons. In
         Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, low level matters are
         handled by general prosecutors, whereas more serious or complex tax crime and corruption
         will be handled by prosecutors specialising in tax crime, corruption, or economic crime
         more generally. Other countries have prosecutors specialising in tax crime but not
         corruption or vice versa. For example, in Uganda, the Revenue Authority has specialised
         tax crime prosecutors, whereas other financial crimes, including corruption, are handled
         by general prosecutors. Rwanda’s NPPA has an Economic and Financial Crime Unit that
         is responsible for the prosecution of financial crimes generally, however, the Office of the
         Ombudsman also has prosecutors that are specialised in corruption cases.
         42. Clear guidelines are important in countries where more than one agency is able
         to prosecute the same offences or types of offences. This includes guidance on when a
         case will fall within the competency of a specific agency and clear channels for referral
         and communication between the competent prosecution bodies. This may be as simple as
         assigning cases based on the type of offence or the monetary amount involved (in many
         countries these factors will overlap). For example, the Czech Republic has specialised
         prosecutors for crimes with a damage threshold over EUR 5.6 million. This again requires
         detailed guidance on determining the scope of the suspected offence, amounts involved,
         and when and how cases that fall outside the scope of one agency’s mandate should be
         handed over to another competent authority.
         43. General prosecutors must be able to handle complex financial matters. While
         the creation of a dedicated agency or unit is an effective way to ensure prosecutors are
         capable of handling complex cases, this is not the only way for countries to ensure that
         prosecutors are equipped to fight tax crime and corruption. At a minimum, countries
         should ensure that they have general prosecutors capable of handling complex tax crime
         and corruption cases as they arise. This is particularly important in jurisdictions where the
         prosecution has no direct role in investigations and can be achieved through training and
         an effective system for the allocation of financial crime cases.
Institutional frameworks for the prevention of tax crime and corruption
         44. While this chapter is focussed on countries’ models for the enforcement of tax crime
         and corruption, this is not the whole story and almost all countries have frameworks for
         preventing these financial crimes that operate alongside enforcement frameworks. The
         role of prevention frameworks is a broad area and an in-depth analysis of these is beyond
         the scope of this report. However, it is still useful to briefly highlight the important and
         complementary role that preventative institutions play in the fight against tax crime and
         corruption.
         45. In most jurisdictions, the enforcement of taxes and the prevention of tax crime
         is the tax administration’s responsibility. This often involves a range of activities
         including developing and co-ordinating strategies to prevent tax crime (often part of a
         wider tax compliance strategy), setting the policy agenda, promulgating laws, developing
         and disseminating guidance, and raising public awareness. For example, in Bangladesh
         and Vietnam, the tax administration is responsible for educating the public on state tax

"31","30 – 2. Institutional frameworks for the investigation and prosecution of tax crime and corruption
          policies and providing guidance and other support to assist taxpayers in meeting their
          legal obligations. In countries where tax crime may also be investigated outside of the tax
          administration, prevention may be a co-ordinated effort between the tax administration and
          relevant law enforcement bodies. For example, in Canada, where tax crime is primarily the
          responsibility of the tax administration, at times, the prevention of tax crimes, is a concerted
          effort between the tax administration, financial intelligence unit, police, and prosecution
          service.
          46. Preventative frameworks can take a variety of forms. As with models for the
          investigation and prosecution of corruption, preventative frameworks can take a variety
          of forms and carry out a multitude of functions. Again, there is no single “best practice
          model” and countries must develop a framework that is effective within their legal and
          cultural context. To this end, some countries have established multi-purpose agencies that
          combine the enforcement and prevention of corruption. For example, Lithuania’s Special
          Investigation Service (accountable to the President and the Parliament of the Republic of
          Lithuania), works in four core areas; criminal investigation of corruption-related crimes,
          corruption prevention, anti-corruption education and public awareness-raising, and
          analytical anti-corruption intelligence. Kenya’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission
          is mandated to combat and prevent corruption and economic crime in Kenya through
          law enforcement, preventive measures, public education, and promotion of standards and
          practices of integrity, ethics, and anti-corruption.
          47. Other countries have agencies dedicated wholly to the prevention of crime with no
          investigative or enforcement function. While these agencies do not have law enforcement
          powers, they may have other responsibilities, such as control over asset declarations.
          For example, Turkey’s Council of Ethics for Public Service was established to improve
          transparency in public administration, with a special focus on civil servants’ practices. The
          Council set a code of conduct for civil servants and investigates complaints against public
          officials and their asset declarations, but is not able to enforce its decisions with disciplinary
          measures. In France, the Agence Française Anti-Corruption (established in March 2017),
          reports to the Ministries of Justice and Budget and is mainly in charge of overseeing the
          implementation of preventive anti-corruption measures taken by large companies 24 subject
          to a legal duty of prevention. In Ukraine, the National Agency on Corruption Prevention
          (created in 2016) has no law-enforcement powers and performs a range of preventative
          functions, including maintaining and verifying a register of e-declarations on assets and
          financial obligations submitted by civil servants and public officials.
          48. In other jurisdictions, there is no one institution tasked with prevention, and this
          is instead a co-ordinated effort across a range of government agencies with a corruption
          prevention mandate.

                                     Benefits of effective co-operation
         49. Corruption and tax crime are closely linked. Co-operation between tax authorities
         and anti-corruption authorities is essential to effectively combat tax crime and corruption.
         As highlighted throughout this report, the two roles of authorities responsible for tackling
         these offences are linked as tax crime and corruption often occur together. Conduct that
         violates anti-corruption laws, such as embezzlement or bribery, also violates tax laws
         when the income is not reported to revenue authorities or bribe payments are deducted
         as business expenses. Similarly, tax evasion may be enabled through the bribery of tax
         officials. Importantly, the need for co-operation may also arise if only one offence has been
         substantiated, since the other authority may be able to share information relevant to that
         offence or the information gathered could allow the other authority to substantiate other
         offences. Despite this, the majority of countries have separate authorities responsible for
         investigating tax crime and corruption. This operational and conceptual separation can be
         a barrier to implementing effective measures for combating financial crime.
         50. The nexus between corruption and tax crime is particularly important in
         developing countries. Surveys conducted by the World Bank Group’s International Finance
         Corporation show that of the more than 131 000 firms polled world-wide, 29.4% expect to
         give gifts to secure government contracts. The figures are 14.3% for high-income OECD
         countries and 45.6% for countries in the East Asia and Pacific regions. Firms also report that
         world-wide, 13.3% are expected to give gifts in meetings with tax officials – figures show a
         similar contrast for high-income OECD countries and East Asia and the Pacific (0.7% and
         20.3%, respectively). 1 These figures show that corruption is a key development challenge,
         and underscore the importance of inter-agency co-operation in these environments.
         51. Co-operation is required for a comprehensive response to financial crime. Many
         governments have created dedicated enforcement bodies for key financial crimes, such as
         tax evasion, money laundering, corruption, and social benefit fraud. Although these bodies
         enable a specialised operational focus, criminals often breach multiple criminal laws.
         These threats require authorities to work closely together to develop a coherent strategy to
         attack perpetrators, groups of perpetrator, and criminal conduct that spans multiple crime
         types. Inter-agency co-operation provides authorities with the necessary tools through:
         (i) better intelligence and generation of leads; (ii) a broader set of investigative powers;
         (iii) augmentation of staff numbers and skills; (iv) improved ability to identify and deal
         with organised crime groups; and (v) the ability to leverage other agencies’ investigative
         work, potentially resulting in greater efficiency and impact.

              Box 3.1. Example of a revenue authority with a public corruption investigation
                                                unit: the United States IRS-CI
                  The United States Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) has created
            an entire unit dedicated to public corruption investigations. This unit’s work focuses on a wide
            range of corruption offences in the tax context, such as bribery, extortion, embezzlement,
            illegal kickbacks, tax fraud, and money laundering. Although the United States Department of
            Justice (DOJ) has primary responsibility for the criminal enforcement of corruption offences
            at the federal level, the mandate given to IRS-CI with respect to public corruption reflects
            the interconnectedness of tax crime and corruption. This unit complements the existing
            co-operation between IRS-CI and DOJ (for example, joint operations). In 2016 alone, IRS-CI
            initiated 84 public corruption investigations, not including cases that fall under the category of
            general tax fraud, abusive tax schemes, and other categories of tax crime, many of which may
            also involve corruption.* Case examples include:
                  •   A former State Senator who received over USD 150 000 in bribes from a “hospital
                      owner who wanted a law to remain in effect so he could continue to reap tens of
                      millions of dollars in illicit profits from a health care fraud scheme.”
                  •   A former Fire Department Treasurer who embezzled more than USD 1.1 million
                      which he used to make payments on his home mortgage loan as well as other personal
                      expenditures. The Treasurer failed to report this income on his personal income return.
                  •   A former Congressperson who received 10 years imprisonment for bribery, wire fraud,
                      honest services fraud, money laundering, and mail fraud.

          52. This chapter highlights typical areas of co-operation between tax authorities and
          anti-corruption authorities. These areas are summarised in Table 3.1 and expanded on in
          the body of the chapter. The chapter concludes with case examples in which tax authorities
          and anti-corruption authorities have co-operated to achieve better law enforcement
          outcomes.

           Threat assessment      • Tax authority may identify trends or large groups of individuals within an organisation
                                    (government or private sector) that are red-flag indicators for corruption
                                  • Anti-corruption authority may provide a risk profile of the types of officials and organisations
                                    with a higher likelihood of engaging in corruption
           Detection              • Tax authority may detect indicators of corruption such as taxpayers whose known income could
                                    not support their lifestyle or who are attempting to conceal payments to public officials
                                  • Anti-corruption authority may detect indicators of tax crime such as assets or income that an
                                    individual or company has attempted to conceal or a corruption scheme involving officials of a
                                    customs or tax authority
           Referral               • Either authority may refer suspicions of either tax crime or corruption to the appropriate
                                    investigative authorities or public prosecutor
                                  • Either authority may refer suspicions that the proceeds of corruption or tax crime have been
                                    laundered to the national FIU or appropriate law enforcement authority

           Information sharing     • Either authority may share intelligence and evidence collected through criminal investigations,
                                     including from suspect interviews, witnesses, surveillance, searches, and subpoenas
                                   • Where permissible, either authority may have access to extensive databases covering
                                     personal and company information such as income, assets, financial transactions, and banking
                                     information
                                   • Authorities may leverage mutual legal assistance agreements to obtain evidence, intelligence
                                     or other assistance from foreign countries in multi-jurisdictional cases, including foreign tax
                                     administrations
           Joint investigations    • Both authorities can work together to de-conflict cases, form joint strategies, and maximise
           and sharing capability    enforcement outcomes
                                   • Either authority may bolster corruption investigations and tax crime investigations by applying
                                     the tools and skills of the other authority
                                   • Tax authorities may undertake more quickly and efficiently net worth analyses of subjects
                                   • Anti-corruption authorities may investigate potential corrupt behaviour underlying tax data,
                                     audit findings, and tax investigations

           enforcement outcomes      the revenue authority
                                   • Tax authorities may seek additional sanctions for the failure to declare proceeds of corruption

                                   • One authority may pursue alternative measures when the other cannot. For example, if bribery
                                     cannot be established the tax crime authority may pursue tax fraud or unexplained wealth
                                     proceedings to recover proceeds of corruption (where possible)
                                   • Prosecution authorities can make strategic decisions about whether or not to combine charges
                                     for tax crimes, corruption, and other financial crimes, into a single prosecution.
           Institutional integrity • Where appropriate, tax authorities may alert the anti-corruption authority to cases of serious
                                     tax non-compliance involving public officials, including officials of the anti-corruption authority
                                     itself
                                   • Anti-corruption authorities may assess corruption risks in the revenue authority and work with
                                     its management to pursue more vigorously cases of internal corruption
           Policy development      • Both authorities may be involved in developing or shaping economic crime policy
Threat assessment
         53. A joint assessment of corruption threats can help focus enforcement resources.
         Threat assessments can demonstrate links between apparently separate cases, inform law
         enforcement and regulatory strategy, enhance detection, and help to set priorities. Central
         to the threat assessment is the identification of corruption hot spots within areas such as:
         (i) high-risk firms operating in corruption-prone sectors and foreign markets (ii) doing
         business with the public sector in countries with high levels of corruption; and (iii) public
         officials working in procurement, private sector regulation, and state-owned enterprises;
         handling cash and assets; and with access to economic and political information that has a
         bearing on the prices of stocks, bonds, currencies, and real estate. The assessment is based
         on anti-corruption authorities’ data related to complaints, cases, and sanctions, and tax
         authorities’ financial data pointing to anomalies among certain groups of civil servants
         and companies.

Detection
          54. With proper training, tax examiners and auditors may detect indicators of
          possible corruption in the course of examining the financial affairs, transactions, and
          records of individuals, companies, and other tax payers. This is more likely to occur when
          corruption transactions are “on the books”, meaning they appear in the financial records
          or accounts, as opposed to transactions that are “off the books”, meaning not recorded.
          Tax examiners, who are already expertly equipped to identify indicators of possible tax
          evasion, should also be alert to indicators of possible bribery or corruption. To recognise
          these indicators, tax examiners and auditors should use the same analytical and audit skills,
          training, experience, and judgment applied to detect possible tax evasion.
          55. However, identification in the anti-corruption context requires knowledge of
          what the possible indicators of bribery and corruption look like. In the tax examination/
          audit context, indicators of possible bribery or corruption fall into two broad groups:
          affirmative indications and affirmative acts. Affirmative indications are not in themselves
          sufficient to establish corruption, but indicate that corrupt acts may have been committed.
          Affirmative acts, on the other hand, establish that corruption has occurred by reference to
          a particular action or series of actions that were deliberately committed for the purpose of
          deception, concealment, or to disguise the facts. The indicators of potential corruption that
          tax examiners should look out for are discussed in detail in Chapter 6 of this report. Tax
          examiners and auditors may also consult the OECD Bribery and Corruption Awareness
          Handbook for Tax Examiners and Tax Auditors which provides comprehensive information
          about the indicators of corruption in the context of tax examinations and audits.

          56. Similarly, with proper training, corruption investigators and prosecutors may
          detect tax crime in the course of their duties. Corruption investigations focus on uncovering
          concealed transactions, such as plans to provide a bribe payment or measures to embezzle
          public funds. An investigation may commence once an allegation of corruption is detected.
          Sources for such allegations can include tip-offs by victims, witnesses, or others who know
          the offender; self-reporting by individual or corporate offenders; other reports by members
          of the public or media; reports by other government agencies, including tax officials and
          other law enforcement agencies; tip-offs by whistle-blowers or ex-employees of a suspect
          corporation; or intelligence developed by another intelligence or law enforcement body or
          the corruption investigation authority itself.
          57. To develop a case once an allegation is detected, corruption investigators look for
          evidence necessary to prove the corruption, such as financial transactions, correspondence,

         or witness testimony. An individual or company willing to commit corruption is also likely
         to be willing to commit tax crime and the two types of misconduct often occur together.
         Accordingly, corruption investigators should also be alert to tax crime red flags when
         conducting investigations. Consider, for example, a company that bribes a public official to
         produce illegitimate receipts so that the company can improperly claim VAT refunds from
         the tax authority. A corruption investigator looking for evidence of bribery should also be
         aware that this case involves a tax crime, namely VAT fraud.
         58. To identify indicators of tax evasion, corruption investigators should generally use
         the same investigative skills, training, experience, and judgment applied to investigate
         corruption. However, corruption investigators must have awareness of what the possible
         indicators of tax crime look like. For example, corruption investigations may uncover
         hidden assets, income, transactions or accounts that should have been declared to tax
         authorities under domestic legislation. A corruption investigation may also reveal illicit
         payments that were disguised as legitimate payments and for which a tax deduction was
         improperly claimed. Any corruption scheme involving tax or customs officials should also
         indicate a tax crime red flag. Indicators of potential tax crime that corruption investigators
         should be aware of are detailed in Chapter 6 of this report.
              Box 3.2. Corruption case detected through assessment of suspected tax crime
                                                          – Georgia
                 The Investigation Service of the Ministry of Finance of Georgia is a specialised law
            enforcement authority separate to the tax administration. The Investigation Service may
            investigate tax offences and also corruption offences where they are detected in the course
            of its activities. In 2014, the Investigation Service began investigating a group of related
            companies suspected of committing tax crime facilitated by forged documents.
                 The investigator engaged the Audit Department of the Revenue Service of the Ministry
            of Finance to reassess the companies’ tax liabilities. The companies had defrauded the tax
            authority by artificially inflating their expenses in connection with a state-run construction
            project, thus fraudulently reducing (on paper) their taxable income.
                 In parallel, the Investigation Service analysed the documentation provided by the companies
            in connection with the tax evasion and uncovered a corruption scheme involving fraud.
            The companies, which were delivering major construction projects for three separate public
            agencies, defrauded the state by charging for works they had not completed and using falsified
            documentation to support their claims to the state agencies and to the relevant banks. As a
            result, important construction works for the public were undermined. The investigation also
            discovered that the individual directors of the various companies were related to each other and
            had laundered the proceeds of their fraud by purchasing real estate and other property.
                 Georgia notes that the relevant state officials involved in the contracts with the companies
            were partly responsible for failing to prevent the fraud. They did not exercise proper controls
            over the construction process, failed to verify the companies’ claims, and failed to exercise
            contractual rights concerning the service agreement between them and the companies.

"39","38 – 3. Benefits of effective co-operation
Referral
          59. Countries should put in place frameworks that enable or require tax authorities to
          report suspicions of corruption, and anti-corruption authorities to report suspicions of
          tax crime, to the appropriate law enforcement authority. There is an obligation on both
          authorities to do so in many countries where suspicions are detected in the course of a tax
          examination or audit, or in the course of a criminal investigation. Even in the absence of an
          obligation, it is a good practice to report suspicions provided this is lawful.
          60. While investigating suspected corruption is the role of the appropriate law enforcement
          authority, tax authorities have an important detection role and a referral by a tax examiner
          or auditor may lead to a full investigation that would not otherwise take place. Referral can
          also facilitate action by the appropriate authority to recover the proceeds of corruption. As
          a result, the financial benefit from corrupt activity is taken away. Similarly, a referral by the
          anti-corruption authority to a tax administration for tax assessment purposes or a tax crime
          investigation agency can lead to successful tax recovery (for example through reassessment
          of tax liability) or prosecution for tax crime. Tax administrations may be able to ensure that
          individuals and companies are required to pay tax on all of their income, while denying a
          deduction for expenses related to criminal activity. Reporting suspicions of possible tax
          crime and corruption is covered in further detail in Chapter 5.
          61. For either authority, there may also be an obligation and significant benefit to report
          suspicions to the national financial intelligence unit (FIU) where there are indicators of
          possible money laundering of the proceeds of corruption or tax crime. The OECD Money
          Laundering Awareness Handbook for Tax Examiners and Tax Auditors is a practical guide
          to raise awareness of issues surrounding money laundering and the indicators of possible
          money laundering that tax examiners and auditors may come across in the course of their
          work.
Information sharing
          62. Tax authorities often hold information that may assist a corruption investigation.
          As discussed in Chapter 5 on information sharing, almost all countries provide some
          mechanism for tax authorities (civil and criminal) to share information with corruption
          investigation authorities. The information may include extensive databases held by the tax
          authority covering personal and company information such as income, assets, financial
          transactions, and banking information which may reveal information pertinent to a
          corruption investigation. However, countries need to have clear frameworks in place to
          determine when and how information gathered for tax assessment purposes can be used in
          a criminal investigation. Similarly, anti-corruption authorities may hold information that
          may assist a tax crime investigation. This may include suspicions of tax crime or other
          intelligence or evidence gleaned from investigations, including from suspect interviews,
          witnesses, surveillance, searches, and subpoenas. Prosecution, police, and anti-corruption
          authorities may also be able to leverage mutual legal assistance agreements to obtain
          information or other assistance from foreign countries in multi-jurisdictional cases.
Joint investigations and sharing capability
          63. Tax crime investigation authorities and anti-corruption authorities may engage
          in closer co-operation with each other in the actual investigation of cases or groups of
          cases. This allows authorities to de-conflict cases, form joint strategies, and streamline

         investigations by focusing on crimes that are easier to prove (without jeopardising their
         case load deliverables), thus maximising enforcement outcomes. Closer co-operation may
         occur through co-ordinated joint operations or taskforces that pursue cases involving
         both tax crime and corruption. The benefits of these forms of enhanced co-operation are
         detailed in Chapter 7.
         64. Tax crime investigation and anti-corruption authorities can bolster each other’s
         investigations. Tax authorities can bolster a corruption investigation by applying specialised
         tools and skills common to tax examiners and auditors, such as undertaking net worth
         analyses of suspects or conducting analysis to disentangle and make sense of complex
         financial transactions. Anti-corruption authorities may have special enforcement powers not
         available to the tax authorities, such as powers of arrest and the power to lay more serious
         criminal charges. Anti-corruption authorities also have experience with and knowledge
         of criminal conspiracies that may assist tax investigators to uncover connections between
         separate tax frauds. They may also investigate potential corrupt behaviour underlying
         tax data, audit findings, and tax investigations so that the authorities can collectively put
         together the full picture of criminality. One authority may have developed or acquired a
         special technical capacity that could assist the other, such as processes and technology for
         mapping and interrogating computer-hard-drives, or other analytical software for managing
         and searching large pools of data. The mandate of one authority may also include specialised
         investigative instruments or resources that the other may not have, for example, the ability to
         tap phones or the availability of mobile squads for the surveillance of suspects.
         65. Strengthened enforcement outcomes. By working together in a complementary
         manner, tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities can ensure that all aspects of
         criminality or non-compliance in a particular case are comprehensively dealt with. In most
         countries, authorities handling corruption cases are able to consider seeking additional
         sanctions for the failure to declare proceeds of corruption or for claiming a deduction
         for bribe payments. Alternatively, it may be preferable to pursue charges or regulatory
         measures within the purview of the tax authority or tax crime investigation authority
         when bribery cannot be established, such as charges for tax fraud or unexplained wealth
         proceedings. Some countries also have non-conviction based asset recovery, meaning
         that authorities can initiate civil (rather than criminal) proceedings to recover proceeds of
         corruption, and do not require a criminal conviction to do so. Anti-corruption authorities
         may contribute to ensuring comprehensive treatment of cases by taking criminal action
         against acts of corruption identified by the revenue authority and by investigating alleged
         acts of corruption.
Institutional integrity
         66. Anti-corruption authorities play an important role in protecting the integrity of
         the tax authority itself. They may investigate cases of corruption involving tax officials,
         assess the corruption risks in the revenue authority, and work with its management to
         pursue more vigorously cases of internal corruption. Unfortunately, tax and customs
         officials are sometimes bribed to facilitate tax evasion. Tax officials are targeted for
         corruption because they are in positions of power regarding tax collection and can facilitate
         tax evasion. By enforcing anti-corruption laws strictly and working with tax authorities to
         strengthen internal integrity measures, anti-corruption authorities help to deter corruption
         and promote a culture of integrity within the tax authority.
         67. Tax authorities may, in turn, promote the integrity of the public sector by alerting
         other authorities to serious tax non-compliance cases involving public officials, including

          those working within anti-corruption authorities. Serious tax non-compliance may indicate
          that a staff member is seeking to conceal income and may be at risk of being influenced
          improperly in the course of their duties. For example, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
          is able to access its taxpayer databases for the purposes of providing background checks
          to individuals being considered for positions within the Prime Minister’s Office, the
          Prosecution Service, and the Department of Justice. When the Revenue Agency has received
          a signed consent form, it conducts a background check to determine if there are any serious
          compliance issues (e.g. issues with an individual’s filing status, or outstanding debts with
          the Revenue Agency).
Policy development
          68. Both authorities should be consulted in the development of relevant economic crime
          policy whether the policy development is driven by the tax authority, tax crime investigation
          authority, anti-corruption authority, or another government agency. Policy in this context
          may include matters such as sentencing reform for economic offences, case settlement
          procedures for corporate defendants, or selection of priority targets for regulatory or law
          enforcement activities.
Examples
          69. The following case examples from Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Hungary
          highlight the needs, benefits, and results of co-operation between tax authorities and anti-
          corruption authorities in practice.
                       Box 3.3. Joint tax and anti-corruption authority investigation of
                                           a GST fraud scheme – Australia
                 Operation X in Australia was a multi-agency joint investigation led by the Australian
            Federal Police (AFP) into suspected systemic defrauding of GST. (Operation X’s mission was
            to effectively investigate the alleged offences to obtain and collate admissible evidence in order
            to successfully prosecute the principal offenders.
                 The joint agency investigation was formalised in a Joint Agency Agreement and overseen
            by a Joint Management Committee, comprising the AFP Co-ordinator of Crime Operations
            and National Director of the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) Serious Non-Compliance area.
            The overall direction and scope of the investigation was decided collectively by AFP and ATO
            management through the Joint Management Committee.
                 As the lead agency, AFP responsibilities under a joint agency investigation agreement
            included provision of a range of capabilities including, investigations, intelligence, physical
            surveillance, computer forensics, and primary responsibility for the brief of evidence and
            proceeds of crime action. AFP skills and expertise exercised in Operation X included tactical
            decision making, drafting affidavits for search warrants and facilitating access to other law
            enforcement agencies.
                 The key ATO areas involved in the joint agency investigation were Fraud Prevention and
            Internal Investigations (FPII) and the Serious Non-Compliance (later Private Groups and
            High Wealth Individuals) Investigations area. The ATO’s responsibilities included provision
            of investigation capability, data mining, dissemination and exchange of information, computer

            forensic assistance, intelligence support, facilitation of audit resources and expert financial
            advice. Key ATO staff were out-posted to the AFP to provide ongoing investigative support
            and facilitate disclosure of ATO protected information, which included taxpayer data, high
            level analysis of the data and FPII relevant information.
                 The AFP, under proceeds of crime legislation, seized over AUD 1.5 million in cash from
            three individuals linked to Operation X. These three individuals were successfully prosecuted
            for dealing in money reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime.
                 The joint agency investigation resulted in the successful prosecution of a former ATO staff
            member and three individuals suspected of corrupting the former ATO staff member have also
            been charged with conspiracy offences. Two of the three individuals have also been charged
            and found guilty of numerous state based offences not directly related to the abovementioned
            crimes.

                             an organised crime group – Bosnia and Herzegovina
                 This case involved a joint investigation into alleged tax evasion, tax fraud, money
            laundering, and corruption committed by an organised crime group across international
            borders. A number of individuals and corporations have been charged with criminal offences
            in connection with this major case. The details have been anonymised and generalised because
            the matter is ongoing.
                 The alleged offences involve a scheme in which goods were imported into Bosnia and
            Herzegovina and sold to fictitious (and legitimate) buyers. A range of tax evasions and
            frauds were at the centre of the scheme, including failure to pay VAT and other taxes on
            transportation, freight, and delivery fees; fictitious invoices and other documentation that
            recorded the false sale of goods and understated the price of those goods; and concealment of
            the actual sale of the goods to legitimate customers. As a result, the group did not pay VAT on
            various services and, at the same time, through the use of fictitious invoices and by concealing
            actual sales, submitted to the tax authority fraudulent claims for VAT credit. The scheme was
            well concealed and was conducted for a number of years before it was detected.
                 In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the prosecutor who assesses a case may decide to set up an
            investigation team composed of officers from several agencies. The prosecutor manages the
            investigation and issues orders and instructions. The prosecutor may order that officers of
            one agency conduct the investigation and that other agencies provide assistance and act on
            instructions of the person designated by the prosecutor. Alternatively, the prosecutor may
            directly manage the investigation, distribute assignments and instructions.
                 To investigate the present case, the lead prosecutor set up a joint investigation team
            comprised of three law-enforcement agencies: Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
            Indirect Taxation Authority and the State Investigation and Protection Agency. Each of these
            agencies has its own internal criminal investigation units. Bosnia and Herzegovina explains
            that due to the complexity of the case, the prosecutor decided to manage the joint investigation
            directly (a financial and tax expert advisor and an investigator with experience in corruption
            offences, both from the Prosecutor’s Office, were also included in the investigation team).

               Box 3.4. Joint investigation into cross-border tax crime and other offences by
                      an organised crime group – Bosnia and Herzegovina (continued)
            The prosecutor determined that involving the three agencies was necessary due to the nature
            of the case:
                 •   Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BP), which controls border crossings
                     and may investigate offences related to border crossings and customs clearance
                     procedures. In this case, goods were crossing borders regularly and in large
                     quantities. It was necessary to involve BP in order to have quick access to the control
                     of border and customs houses, access to the databases of entry and exists maintained
                     by the BP and to have BP personnel and systems available for the investigation. In
                     addition, BP was part of the team responsible for searching trucks and goods at the
                     customs terminal when the joint investigation team conducted searches.
                 •   Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA), which is responsible for compliance with tax
                     and customs legislation and may investigate matters concerning tax liabilities and
                     other tax related issues. The involvement of ITA was necessary because the primary
                     subject of the investigation was tax evasion and tax fraud. ITA investigation units had
                     the expertise, experience, and resources required to investigate these types of offences,
                     such as specific knowledge of tax and customs procedures. ITA investigators (both
                     tax and customs inspectors) also had direct access to databases about import, customs
                     clearance, and taxation of goods. Among other things, during searches, the task of the
                     tax investigators was to search and later analyse business and financial documents.
                 •   State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA), which has general competence
                     over investigations into criminal offences provided for in the country’s Criminal
                     Code, including corruption offences. At the outset of the investigation, the prosecutor
                     determined that, noting the case involved organised crime, it would likely become
                     necessary to collect information, conduct surveillance, carry out searches, detain
                     suspects, conduct witness interviews, and possibly controlled/undercover operations,
                     which are areas in which SIPA has the most experience and most appropriate resources.
                     SIPA is also the corruption investigation authority, which is relevant because the
                     investigation initially included assessment of bribery of certain customs officers
                     suspected of being connected to the organised crime group. Among other things, SIPA
                     investigators were responsible for preparing and securing the search locations, such as
                     suspects’ homes, by using appropriate police techniques and with the support of ITA
                     where necessary.
                 The success of this complex and large investigation was a result of close collaboration
            between the three agencies, overseen by the prosecutor, in which each agency contributed
            complementary skills and information to advance the investigation. The joint investigation
            team met regularly to review progress, exchange information, and allocate tasks in addition
            to separate bilateral meetings between the prosecutor and each agency, where necessary. The
            co-operation ultimately culminated in co-ordinated, joint-BP-ITA-SIPA searches, seizures
            and arrests at multiple locations across the country. The co-operation continued in the final
            investigation phase during which evidentiary material was processed and analysed by the joint
            team to prepare the case for prosecution.

                 In Hungary, co-operation between the National Taxation and Customs Administration
            (NTCA) (both the civil and criminal areas of NTCA were involved) and the anti-corruption
            unit of the Budapest Police Headquarters, led to the derailment of a major fraud scheme. The
            scheme involved multiple companies and individuals, including a corrupt official within the
            NTCA.
                 NTCA detected a group of executives who appeared to be involved in “phoenixing” – a
            practice which involves setting up companies to accumulate large amounts of debt and then
            liquidating those companies so that the executives make a profit and the debts are not paid. It
            was discovered that an NTCA tax official was assisting the executives with their scheme.
                 During the investigation, the internal control department of NTCA received an official
            request from the anti-corruption unit of the Budapest Police Headquarters stating that it was
            investigating a related suspect for reasonable suspicion of abuse of power and maladministration.
            The anti-corruption unit sought information about the tax official in question, who had already
            been identified by the internal control department of NTCA, in connection with four suspected
            companies. The police then launched its investigation based on information provided by the
            NTCA. This included information obtained by NTCA through covert wiretaps of a suspect.
                 Following further investigation, NTCA informed the police that it had detected a much
            wider pool of suspects. This wider investigation uncovered a fraud scheme involving 35
            individuals and 85 companies. During a co-ordination meeting with the criminal authority of
            NTCA, it was agreed that the data obtained by the NTCA would also be passed on to the anti-
            corruption unit to prove fiscal frauds. The cases were successfully resolved.
                 Hungary points to a range of benefits arising from the co-operation, including the ability to
            undertake joint action, exchange information including data that was gathered through covert
            measures, and ultimately resolve a much larger number of cases than would have otherwise
            been possible if each authority had acted alone.

                                                         Chapter 4
                         Overcoming challenges to effective co-operation
         70. There are common challenges that prevent tax authorities and anti-corruption
         authorities from opening and maintaining effective communication channels, sharing
         information, and working together on joint investigations. In order to improve co-operation
         between anti-corruption authorities and tax authorities it is important that countries
         consider and identify whether any of these challenges are present.
         71. In most countries, tax administrations and anti-corruption authorities are separate.
         Naturally, separate authorities may be governed by different laws and they generally have
         different working methods and operational mandates and priorities. The same may even
         be said of anti-corruption and tax crime units that operate within the same authority. As
         Brazil put it:
              The greatest challenges involve getting the different agencies and government
              bodies to conciliate their diverse agendas, priorities and strategic objectives. Since
              each agency has its own set of difficulties and objectives, agreeing on the approach
              in a specific investigation is not always easy.
         72. In this chapter, challenges to improved co-operation are separated into three broad
         groups: legal (the lack of a legal basis for co-operation), operational (the absence of an
         effective operational framework for co-operation), and cultural/political (the lack of culture
         that supports co-operation and inadequate high-level encouragement for co-operation). The
         chapter explains the challenges and presents a selection of examples from countries that
         have taken measures to address them.
Legal basis
         73. The lack of a legal basis for co-operation, or legal restrictions on co-operation,
         presents a fundamental challenge. Legal barriers to improved co-operation include
         specific restrictions and prohibitions which apply to prevent an agency obtaining access to
         relevant information held by another agency. The lack of a legal basis or the existence of an
         insufficient legal basis for information sharing between tax authorities and anti-corruption
         authorities arise in circumstances where:
              •   The law prohibits information sharing from one authority to another. An
                  analysis of the countries surveyed for this report shows that such prohibitions are
                  rare in practice. Only two countries participating in this report have an explicit
                  prohibition on the tax administration from sharing information with the authority
                  responsible for conducting corruption investigations. These are known as tax
                  secrecy laws and are common in many countries. However, most countries have
                  introduced exceptions that allow tax information to be shared for the enforcement

"47","46 – 4. Overcoming challenges to effective co-operation
                  of non-tax offences. Only five countries prohibit anti-corruption authorities from
                  sharing information with tax authorities for use in administering taxes and all
                  countries allow the corruption investigation authority to provide information to the
                  authority responsible for investigating tax crime.
              •   The law provides a legal basis for sharing, but it is insufficient. Challenges
                  to information sharing may also arise where the legal basis for sharing exists but
                  restrictions prevent full and effective information sharing. Tax authorities may be
                  allowed to share information with anti-corruption authorities only in relation to a
                  certain set of corruption offences. If this set of offences is too narrow or not kept
                  up to date as new corruption offences are introduced to the statute book, effective
                  information sharing could be curtailed. Further, rules that allow information
                  sharing in general may not ensure enhanced forms of co-operation, such as joint
                  operations or taskforces. These particular forms of co-operation are examined in
                  Chapter 7.
              •   The legal basis for information sharing is difficult to apply in practice. The
                  legal basis for information sharing may be difficult to use if it imposes undue
                  restrictions on the use of information obtained or involves time consuming or costly
                  processes. Countries should avoid undue restrictions on the use of the information
                  obtained from a tax authority or anti-corruption authority. For example, if the
                  law prescribes that information obtained from the tax authority may be used for
                  investigative purposes but not as evidence in proceedings, this will likely present an
                  unnecessary barrier to successful prosecution of corruption offences. In addition,
                  the law may require that a formal criminal procedure be commenced under the
                  authority of a public prosecutor, or that a court order or ministerial approval be
                  obtained, before an anti-corruption authority may receive information covered
                  by tax secrecy. These processes provide oversight and a mechanism to balance
                  the interests of protecting personal or confidential information with the interests
                  of the corruption investigation authority. However, they may increase the cost of
                  obtaining information in a corruption investigation and cause delay particularly if
                  the processes are not routine. A streamlined process should be provided in these
                  circumstances to avoid unnecessary delays and costs.
              •   The law only allows information sharing on request or provides no legal
                  obligation to share. Finally, a challenge arises where the law only allows information
                  sharing on request. In these circumstances, if an anti-corruption or tax authority
                  detects information of interest to the other, it can only be shared if the other authority
                  actively seeks it out. As a result, there is less chance that the information will reach
                  the other authority. A separate issue arises where there is no legal obligation to share
                  and officials have the discretion to pick and choose when they share information. In
                  this second situation, agencies should implement internal policies on the types of
                  information that should be shared (and when and how this should occur) to ensure
                  that this discretion is exercised appropriately.
          74. Maintaining undue legal barriers to co-operation between anti-corruption and tax
          authorities (whether for the purpose of administering taxes or investigating tax crime or
          corruption) is inconsistent with a whole-of-government approach to combating financial
          crime. Such laws do not reflect the complexity of combating modern financial crime,
          particularly the need for information sharing between tax authorities and anti-corruption
          authorities for the purpose of investigating serious corruption or tax crime, or for proper
          tax administration. However, laws providing for the sharing of information, and the policy

         framework around such laws, should ensure that information sharing does not harm an
         ongoing investigation, for example, by tipping off a suspect. Due regard should also be had
         to protecting confidential information as appropriate and within the country’s domestic
         legal framework and in line with taxpayer rights and international human rights principles.
               Box 4.1. Examples of contemporary law reform – Finland and New Zealand
                Until recently in Finland, the law provided that the tax administration may only provide
           information to the anti-corruption authority (the police) on request, which is an approach
           common to many countries. However, on 1 May 2018, amendments to the Act on the Public
           Disclosure and Confidentiality of Tax Information came into force permitting the spontaneous
           sharing of information at the discretion of the tax administration. These were the combined
           effort of policy experts from the tax administration and Ministry of Justice (responsible for
           anti-corruption policies).
                Similarly, New Zealand is currently considering proposals for modernising the Tax
           Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). In this regard a Government Discussion Document was
           released in late 2016 that included the subject of tax information and confidentiality. Tax secrecy
           in relation to a taxpayer’s individual affairs is seen as a critical component of the integrity of the
           New Zealand tax system. However, New Zealand has identified that the current rules can lead
           to tensions, in particular, tensions between confidentiality and wider Government objectives,
           including the more efficient operation of Government agencies in combating financial crime.
           The discussion document is proposing to modernise the information protection and disclosure
           framework in the TAA by moving to a regulatory model permitting information sharing (that
           meets certain legislated criteria) to be authorised by order in council. This new framework
           would encompass information sharing between Inland Revenue and other Government agencies,
           including the corruption investigation authority, to assist improved detection and investigation
           of serious corruption offences.
Operational framework
         75. An effective operational framework facilitates co-operation by reducing friction
         and smoothing interaction. Operational framework refers to the practical and structural
         context in which co-operation takes place, including procedures for requesting information.
         The lack of an operational framework for co-operation is detrimental to effective
         collaboration between authorities. In countries where the anti-corruption authority and
         tax authority have not previously worked together or have had limited experience in
         co-operation, the operational framework is unlikely to be well developed. An effective
         operational framework needs personal and institutional connections between anti-corruption
         and tax authorities. The challenges explored in this section will assist countries seeking to
         establish an operational framework or wanting to identify possible challenges in an existing
         framework.
         76. Complex or lengthy procedures can make information stale and less useful. This
         challenge may be caused or exacerbated by a lack of resources or by authorities simply
         being too slow to respond to requests for assistance. Authorities may also take an inflexible
         approach to assisting other authorities. Alternatively, as discussed in the previous section,
         complex or lengthy procedures may stem from legal requirements that establish formal
         approval procedures that delay and add cost to the information sharing process. Complex
         or lengthy procedures may also stem from the operational or policy settings internal to

"49","48 – 4. Overcoming challenges to effective co-operation
          an anti-corruption or tax authority. For example, challenges may arise where an authority
          has multiple layers of internal approval before it can share information, unclear policies
          governing its information sharing procedure, or fails to issue clear written guidance for
          other authorities. Guidance for other authorities can take the form of a written agreement
          and should explain the procedure that the other authority should follow to request and
          obtain information, including:
              •   a description of the types of information that the authority can provide
              •   who a request for information should be sent to
              •   information about what will happen to the request
              •   who the other authority can contact to follow up
              •   likely timeframes for processing a request, and
              •   a description of what information the requested authority needs in order to process
                  a request.
          77. Co-operation assumes awareness of available information and mechanisms for
          collaboration. A lack of understanding among tax and corruption investigators about the
          types of offences that each other investigate and the types of information each other have
          also undermines the operational framework for co-operation. In the tax crime investigation
          context, this may include a lack of awareness that corruption offences are often committed
          together with tax offences and that anti-corruption authorities may hold useful information
          about a person suspected of tax crime. Similarly, corruption investigation authorities may
          not understand the interplay between corruption and tax crime and may not be aware
          that the tax authority is able to share information (where applicable) that might assist a
          corruption investigation.
          78. Lack of training on using channels for co-operation hinders their adoption.
          This may include training on information sharing gateways as well as enhanced forms of
          co-operation through joint operations and taskforces (see Chapter 7). Effective training for
          tax crime investigators and corruption investigators is discussed in Chapter 6.
          79. Inadequate resources will hamper co-operation. It stands to reason that co-operation
          will be greater between agencies that are adequately resourced to carry out their mandate.
          Agencies that are insufficiently staffed or face other budget constraints may be less able
          to dedicate their time and resources to assisting another agency with an investigation and
          to receive assistance in turn. Budget constraints are of course a political consideration,
          reinforcing the need for leaders to make an all of government approach to combatting
          financial crime a political priority.
Co-operation agreements
          80. A written co-operation agreement, such as a memorandum of understanding
          (MOU), between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities is a simple yet
          effective tool for facilitating a working relationship. An agreement in this context may
          be part of a wider inter-agency agreement, for example between police and tax authorities
          that also covers corruption issues. In general, MOUs provide an administrative framework
          for co-operation that is consistent with the mandates, operational policies, and legislation
          governing the parties. A co-operation agreement such as an MOU between tax authorities
          and anti-corruption authorities should set out, at a minimum:

              •      a shared understanding of the need for co-operation in fighting tax crime and

         81. For example, in Canada the MOU between the CRA and the Royal Canadian
         Mounted Police (RCMP), and the co-operation agreement between the Hungarian tax
         authority and the anti-corruption authority, cover in broad terms, the same main topics
         (including relevant officials, information sharing guidelines, and joint activities), with each
         document containing detail relevant to the particular jurisdiction’s needs.

         needs to be exchanged between the CRA and the RCMP in order to facilitate the effective
         administration of their respective enforcement mandates. The parties recognise that an
         integrated approach to combating financial crime is more effective in disrupting and
         dismantling tax evasion, fraud, capital market fraud, money laundering, proceeds of
         crime, corruption, and other serious and organised crime. The MOU is an administrative
         understanding between the parties and is not legally binding or enforceable before the Courts.

                Box 4.2. Other examples of written agreements between tax authorities and
                           anti‑corruption authorities – Lithuania, Peru and Uganda
                 In Lithuania, the State Tax Inspectorate (STI) and the Special Investigation Service
            (responsible for corruption investigations) have an agreement to co-operate in exchanging data
            and providing assistance in relation to preventing, detecting, and investigating corruption-
            related activities. Under this co-operation agreement, the STI reports to the Special Investigation
            Service instances of corruption that are detected in the course of performing its functions.
            In January 2018, this agreement was amended to ensure the implementation of the non-
            deductibility of bribes, including in relation to the re-examination of tax returns of individuals
            and companies that have been convicted of bribery. In 2017, these and other agencies, including
            the Prosecutor’s Office, the Police Department and the Financial Crime Investigation Service
            of the Ministry of Interior, signed an agreement specifically in relation to affording the widest
            measure of assistance and co-operation in cases involving the bribery of foreign public officials.
                 In Peru, the tax administration (SUNAT) has a set of agreements for the exchange of
            information, technical assistance and training, which allows incorporating information relevant
            to the execution of its control activities, which are invoked as required. Agreements have
            been signed with a number of authorities including the National Police of Peru, responsible
            for corruption investigations. In 2017, SUNAT signed a Framework Agreement with the
            General Comptrollership of the Republic (which has a corruption prevention function through
            supervising, monitoring, and verifying the correct application of public policies and the use
            of resources and assets), that established a strategic alliance for the development of technical
            assistance, information exchange with discretion and training, based on specific agreements
            managed by work teams.
                 In Uganda, to enhance inter-agency co-operation, MOUs have been signed to facilitate
            sharing of information. In each of these MOUs an official contact person is identified at each
            participating agency who is then made responsible for ensuring that the agreements are effective.
Culture and political support
          83. A lack of a culture and political and senior level support for anti-corruption
          authorities and tax authorities to co-operate with each other is a key challenge to successful
          collaboration. At best, successful co-operation in these circumstances is likely to occur
          only on an ad hoc basis, as staff considering seeking assistance from the other authority
          may feel discouraged. It can take time and considerable goodwill to develop a culture and
          political support for co-operation, particularly where two authorities have had little historic
          interaction or have made attempts that went badly or failed. Key indicators of a lack of
          co-operation culture include:
              •    Distrust. A lack of co-operative culture between authorities may be present where
                   authorities have not established trust. This may be present where authorities have
                   historically protected their own information and processes from outsiders and have
                   not experienced the benefits of closer collaboration. It may also stem from bad
                   experiences. For example, if an authority failed to act promptly in response to a
                   referral or request for information from another; unduly took over or was perceived
                   to have unduly taken over an investigation from the contacting authority; or failed
                   to protect confidential information. A particular challenge may arise where one
                   authority has previously conducted an investigation concerning personnel of the
                   other (e.g. the tax authority has previously investigated a corruption investigator
                   for tax evasion or where a tax official is suspected of corruption).

              •   Unsupportive leadership. In the absence of support for stronger co-operation
                  from the senior leadership of the authority or the political figures who oversee
                  it, anti-corruption authorities and tax authorities will have difficulty establishing
                  joint operational mandates and priorities. It also creates a difficult environment
                  for the changes required to remove or reduce legal and operational barriers to
                  information sharing or closer co-operation. This problem may be a function of
                  a range of factors, such as different political agendas between the ministers or
                  senior leadership responsible for anti-corruption and taxation, or it may reflect risk
                  aversion, change aversion, or an unwillingness to embrace a whole-of-government
                  approach to combating financial crime.
              •   Narrow view of an authority’s mandate. A lack of encouragement for co-operation
                  may also stem from a narrow view about an authority’s mandate with respect to
                  combating economic crime. If an individual authority’s priorities and objectives
                  are not aligned with a broader common goal towards combating financial crime
                  through collective efforts, it will be less likely to see value in co-operation.
              •   Lack of independence. Lack of political independence or perceived lack of political
                  independence of either authority may result in distrust and reluctance to share
                  information. In countries where either authority cannot, objectively, be viewed
                  as independent from political influence, officials may not be able to ensure the
                  confidentiality and legitimate use of information shared. This is one circumstance
                  in which strengthened co-operation between tax and anti-corruption authorities
                  may be viewed with caution.

                                                         Chapter 5
                         Gateways for reporting and information sharing
         84. Previous chapters have outlined the importance of effective reporting and information
         sharing between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities. This chapter provides a
         more detailed examination of the legal gateways that countries have in place to permit
         reporting and information sharing between authorities responsible for the administration
         of taxes, tax crime investigations, and corruption investigations. The analysis is based
         on the broad position in each country and is not intended to reflect the complexity of
         the arrangements between agencies within each jurisdiction. 1 A positive finding is that
         the vast majority of countries surveyed for the report either require or permit authorities
         responsible for the administration of taxes and tax crime investigations to report and share
         information with anti-corruption authorities and vice versa. That said, information sharing
         in many countries is subject to restrictions and countries are strongly encouraged, within the
         framework permitted by their law, to make the broadest range of legal gateways available
         for information sharing.
         85. In the course of their normal activities, authorities responsible for both civil and
         criminal tax matters and corruption investigation authorities, all gather and hold important
         information on individuals, companies, and transactions. The information held by one
         authority may therefore provide a valuable source of intelligence to another in combating
         the financial crimes within their respective mandates. Effective reporting of suspicions of
         criminal activity and sharing of information can be used to identify evidence which may
         lead to new investigations, support ongoing investigations, and reduce duplication (thus
         keeping costs down and increasing efficiency). Importantly, mechanisms for reporting and
         information sharing may be used to foster relationships at the agency and investigator level
         which are crucial to the fight against corruption and tax crime.
         86. With respect to the reporting of suspected offences, countries are categorised
         under four broad models: (i) mandatory reporting: officials are under a legal obligation
         to report all suspected instances of tax crime or corruption to the relevant enforcement
         authorities; (ii) discretionary reporting: officials are able, but not required to report;
         (iii) restricted reporting: officials have restrictions placed on when and how they can
         report; and (iv) reporting is not permitted. Discretionary and mandatory reporting can
         both be effective, provided the right structures are in place. This includes having a clearly
         articulated reporting policy, endorsing and communicating that policy, promoting a culture
         from the top that encourages the use of reporting procedures, having governance structures
         in place that provide active oversight of the reporting mechanism, and procedures in place
         for when it is breached. Nonetheless, a well-managed mandatory reporting structure
         will likely yield more reports than a discretionary system, particularly where there
         are consequences for non-compliance.

"55","54 – 5. Gateways for reporting and information sharing
          87. The number of countries within each model is set out in Table 5.1. All countries
          included in this report either require or permit corruption investigation authorities to report
          suspicions of tax crime to the relevant investigative body. Although the majority of countries
          require or permit authorities responsible for both criminal and civil tax matters to report
          suspicions of corruption, a number impose restrictions or prohibitions on such reporting.

          Note: Not all countries provided data on reporting.
          88. In addition to reporting suspected crime, it is also vital that agencies can go on
          to share information relevant to the suspicion with the appropriate law enforcement
          authority. Arrangements for information sharing through legal gateways have been
          grouped into four broad models based on whether agencies can obtain information held by
          another through (i) direct access to the information; (ii) mandatory spontaneous sharing
          of information; (iii) discretionary spontaneous sharing of information; (iv) information
          sharing on request only; and (v) no sharing of information.
          89. Each of these models has advantages and disadvantages which can vary depending
          on whether countries have one or several arrangements in place and how these are
          implemented (e.g. the agencies involved, type of information concerned, and circumstances
          in which it is required). For example, discretionary, spontaneous sharing of information
          may be very effective when there is a longstanding co-operative relationship between the
          agencies involved and a clear understanding of what information may be useful in the
          activities of the recipient agency. This will necessarily require training and guidance on
          what information should be shared and in what circumstances. On the other hand, direct
          access to information may be ineffective in cases where officials are unfamiliar with the
          information available or have not received appropriate training in using systems operated
          by the other agency. Where the information required is very specific in substance or form,
          information on request may be the most suitable model.
          90. In light of this, information sharing will be most effective where countries make
          available a broad range of information sharing gateways between authorities responsible
          for the administration of taxes, investigation of tax crime, and criminal investigation of
          corruption. For example, countries that provide a corruption investigation authority with
          direct access to a tax authority’s database are likely to see more comprehensive and better
          quality sharing of information if the tax authority also provides information which it
          believes is relevant to possible cases of corruption spontaneously and on request where the
          information is thought to be relevant by the corruption investigation authority.

         91. In line with Principle 8 of the OECD’s Ten Global Principles for Fighting Tax Crime 2,
         the key to making the most of any information sharing gateway is having identifiable contact
         points and ensuring that key individuals within each agency have a clear understanding of
         the types of information and powers the other agencies possess. Finally, regardless of the
         legal gateway or combination of legal gateways available in a given country, it is critical
         that countries have safeguards in place to protect the confidentiality of the information they
         hold and the integrity of the work carried out by other agencies. This will often require
         clear parameters on who can access information and for what purpose, as well as having
         defined governance mechanisms to ensure that information is used for its intended purpose.
         This is particularly relevant to information shared by tax administrations given the strong
         confidentiality laws that often apply to information collected and held for tax assessment
         purposes. For example, in Sweden, information shared between agencies through legal
         gateways must at all times comply with the provisions of the Secrecy Act. In many countries
         (e.g. Brazil and the United Sates) court orders are used to safeguard information held by
         relevant corruption and tax crime investigators.
         92. Table 5.2 shows the number of countries that apply these different models for the
         sharing of information by authorities responsible for civil and criminal tax matters with
         corruption investigation authorities, and vice versa.

         93. The framework for, and limits on, information sharing between tax authorities and
         anti-corruption authorities may be set out in law, or contained in agreements between
         the relevant agencies. For example, within the framework of what is permitted by law,
         agencies may enter into co-operation agreements, including MOUs, which contain details
         of the types of information that can be shared, circumstances under which sharing can
         take place, and restrictions on when and how information may be used. Such agreements
         may also set out details such as the format for information requests, details of competent
         officials authorised to deal with requests, agreed notice periods and time limits, or a
         requirement for the receiving agency to provide feedback on the results of investigations
         where the information was used. Having clearly defined parameters for what information
         can be shared, when, and with whom, is critical to creating an environment where officials

          are comfortable and confident with cross-agency co-operation. Any framework that
          leaves space for hesitation, doubt, or uncertainty is counterproductive to co-operation
          and increases the likelihood of evidential issues arising during trial. More information on
          MOUs and examples of MOUs that countries have in place are set out in Chapter 4.
Reporting and sharing of taxpayer information by tax administration
          (i) Reporting of suspicions of corruption by tax administration 3
          94. As described in the OECD Bribery and Corruption Awareness Handbook for Tax
          Examiners and Tax Auditors, while tax officials are not responsible for the detection
          and investigation of corruption, tax administrations often hold valuable information on
          taxpayers’ income, assets, and financial transactions. This can contain important indicators
          of possible corruption as well as information that could prove useful in the course of an
          investigation.

          95. Of the 59 countries that provided information on reporting, 43 impose an obligation
          on the tax administration to report suspected corruption to the public prosecutor, police,
          or other authority responsible for conducting corruption investigations. 4 These obligations
          vary in nature between countries. For example, in Tunisia, there is a general obligation
          on all public officials to report any suspected offence. In Belgium, the Taxpayers’
          Charter means that suspicions of possible corruption may only be reported to the public
          prosecutor and not to the police or any other authority. In 14 countries, the tax authority
          may report suspected corruption to the relevant criminal investigative authority, 5 and just
          two countries place restrictions on reporting. 6 New Zealand does not permit reports of
          corruption unless the information also relates to tax crime and in the United States, the
          IRS can only report suspicions to the Department of Justice once a request for a grand jury
          investigation is approved.
          96. However, despite the fact that 95% countries surveyed require or permit the tax
          authority to report suspicions of corruption, a 2017 OECD study on the Detection of
          Foreign Bribery found that only 2% of concluded foreign bribery cases between 1999 and
          2017 were detected by tax authorities. While not representative of all corruption offences,

         the access that tax administrations have to detailed financial information suggests that
         there could remain significant scope for improvement in how tax administrations identify,
         capture, and report suspicions of corruption that arise during the course their work. This
         was supported by many jurisdictions involved in the study which provided anecdotal
         evidence that co-operation can be inconsistent from case to case, occurring on an ad-hoc
         basis rather than systematically.
         (ii) Sharing of information held by tax administration for tax assessment purposes
         with corruption investigation authorities 7
         97. In ten of the 56 countries that provided data on information sharing, at least
         some authorities competent to conduct investigations into corruption have direct access
         to information held by the tax administration for the purpose of assessing taxes. 8 In
         Moldova, a series of co-operation agreements enables criminal prosecution bodies to
         access the online information resources held by the State Tax Service. In 12 countries,
         the tax administration must spontaneously share civil tax information relevant to a
         corruption investigation. 9 This is often subject to restrictions. For example, in Georgia,
         law enforcement agencies have the right to receive confidential tax information only if it
         concerns a case they are investigating.

         to corruption investigators, but is not required to do so. 10 Again, restrictions apply. For
         example, in Israel, the police must apply to the Minister of Finance to gain access to taxpayer
         information for the purposes of an investigation (though in practice this has been delegated to
         the Director of the Israel Tax Authority and authorisations are routine and regular).
         99. In a further 16 countries the tax administration only provides information to
         corruption investigators on request. 11 In Portugal, the Tax and Customs Authority may
         provide the public prosecutor with certain information relevant to criminal investigations
         spontaneously and is also obliged to provide information on request where a prosecutor
         has determined that tax secrecy provisions should be lifted. Information may be shared
         between the Polícia Judiciária and the Tax and Customs Authority via an established

          information with anti-corruption authorities with the written authority of the Minister of
          Finance or of the person or partnership to whose affairs it relates.
          100. In two countries it is not possible for the tax administration to share information
          with corruption investigators. In Belgium, this is owing to a provision in the Taxpayers’
          Charter restricting co-operation between the tax administration and the federal police. In
          New Zealand, the tax administration is restricted from providing information to the SFO
          other than for the purposes of investigating and/or prosecuting suspected tax offences.
          Information relevant to a possible corruption offence may only be shared if there is an
          associated tax crime to be investigated.
Reporting and sharing information by authorities responsible for tax crime investigations
          (i) Reporting of suspicions of corruption by tax crime investigation
          authorities 12
          101. Of the 52 countries that provided information on reporting, tax crime investigation
          authorities must report suspicions of corruption to the police, public prosecutor, or relevant
          law enforcement authority in 36 countries 13 and are able, but not required to do so in
          13 countries. 14 Both countries that restrict reporting by tax crime authorities do so to the
          same extent that civil authorities are restricted from reporting. 15

          corruption investigation authorities 16
          102. Financial crimes including tax crime and corruption often do not occur in isolation.
          In the course of an investigation into suspected criminal activity, tax crime investigators
          may also uncover information concerning other crimes. To the extent responsibility for
          investigating these other crimes lies with a different agency, it is important that gateways
          are in place for this information to be shared.

         103. Of the 50 countries that provided data on information sharing, 11 provide corruption
         investigators direct access to information held by the authority responsible for tax
         crime investigations. 17 However, in all of these countries, both tax crime and corruption
         investigations are conducted by the police or public prosecutor. In a further 11 countries, the
         tax crime investigation authority has an obligation to share information spontaneously with
         corruption investigators. 18 For example, in Brazil, tax crime and corruption are investigated
         by separate teams within the Organised Crime Directorate of the Federal Police. Where
         the suspected tax crime and corruption are related, both teams can investigate both crimes.
         Where they are not, each team is required to share all relevant information with the other.
         104. In 15 countries, tax crime investigators can spontaneously share information relevant
         to a corruption investigation but are under no obligation to do so. 19 And in 11 countries
         such information can only be provided on request. 20 Three countries do not permit any
         such information sharing. 21
                    Box 5.1. Impact of institutional model for tax crime investigations on
               information sharing between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities
                 In general terms, countries where tax crime investigations are conducted outside the
            tax administration provide for greater sharing of information with corruption investigators,
            although this is not always the case.
                 Of the countries that conduct tax crime investigations within the tax administration, two
            countries allow corruption investigators direct access to information held by the authority
            responsible for tax crime investigations.a Seven countries require the tax crime investigation
            authority to spontaneously share such information,b and 11 countries allow, but do not require,
            spontaneous sharing.c Nine countries allow tax investigators to provide information on requestd
            and a further three countries do not permit any sharing of information.e
                 In contrast, of the countries that can conduct tax crime investigations outside of the tax
            administration, nine countries provide corruption investigators with direct access to information
            held by the tax crime authority.f Five countries require the tax crime investigation authority to

Reporting suspicions and sharing information by a corruption investigation authority
          (i) Reporting of suspicions of tax crime by corruption investigation authorities 22
          105. All 50 countries that provided information on reporting either require or allow
          corruption investigators to report tax crimes. In 28 countries corruption investigators
          are under an obligation to report suspicions of tax crime to the public prosecutor or relevant
          law enforcement agency. 23 In Georgia, when the corruption authority suspects tax crime,
          it can, with the consent of the chief prosecutor or deputy, conduct the investigation itself.
          In Greece, any exchange of information relating to suspected tax crime must take place
          within the framework of co-operation between the relevant and competent agencies. In
          22 countries, authorities responsible for investigating corruption may report suspicions of
          tax crime, but there is no specific obligation for them to do so. 24

         106. Of the 53 countries that responded to this part of the survey, 13 provide the tax crime
         investigation authority direct access to information held by corruption investigators, 26 and 8
         require corruption investigators to spontaneously share information relevant to a tax crime
         investigation with tax crime investigators. In 21 countries, corruption investigators may
         provide information spontaneously to tax crime investigators but can exercise discretion in
         doing so. 27 For example, in Canada, the corruption investigation authority may send leads
         to the tax administration, tax crime investigation authorities, and the customs authority,
         relating to the compliance and enforcement of their acts. There are no restrictions on what
         information may be provided.

         107. In the remaining ten countries, corruption investigators can only provide information
         upon the request of tax crime investigators. 28 For example, in the United States, public
         corruption investigations are typically conducted through a grand jury investigation
         and thus subject to the relevant rules for secrecy. If tax crime investigators are not part
         of a grand jury investigation, they may apply for a court order to obtain information
         gathered during the investigation. Indonesia is the only country surveyed that prohibits its
         corruption investigation authority from sharing information with its tax crime authority.

                          Box 5.2. Financial Criminal Investigation Network (continued)
                  FCInet is a software and infrastructure platform physically located within each authority.
             It contains the data the authorities wish to make available for the purposes of matching to one
             or more FCInet members. The key functionality of the software is data matching. It works by
             pseudonymising information of one or more individuals and/or companies into one key (i.e. a
             string of numbers).
                  Based on FIU.net developed for the Financial Intelligence Units in the European Union,
             the software platform was designed to overcome key organisational, informational, and
             technical challenges to information sharing. FCInet is an initiative of the OECD’s Heads of
             Tax Crime Investigations and is being developed and maintained by the Fiscal Information
             and Investigation Service (FIOD) of the Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration and HM
             Revenue and Customs of the United Kingdom.
                  It is currently being investigated whether the use of FCInet can be further enrolled amongst
             other participants and within law enforcement tax authorities.
The need to better record the frequency of reporting and information sharing by
authorities
          108. The majority of countries surveyed for this report were not able to indicate the
          frequency with which tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities report suspicions of
          crime or share information with each other. The reasons for this varied and it is recognised
          that in some cases capturing this data may be challenging (e.g. if criminal investigators
          have direct access to information held by another agency for different purposes, the
          number of times and the purposes for which they access the information may not be clear).
          However, better recording of the number of times suspicions are reported or information
          is shared, and the outcomes of this co-operation, would improve the ability of a country to
          assess the relationship between reporting and information sharing on the one hand, and the
          number, or success of criminal investigations, on the other.
                  Box 5.3. Examples of effective reporting and information sharing between
                              tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities – Brazil
                  Operation Zelotes
                  In 2013, the Secretariat of the Federal Revenue of Brazil (RFB) (subordinated to the
             Ministry of Finance) received an anonymous complaint about alleged irregularities in the
             functioning of CARF – the Administrative Council of Tax Appeals,established under the
             Ministry of Finance, mandated to hear appeals from the Administrative Courts of First
             Instance (among others) relating to the application of tax legislation. The complaint suggested
             that certain CARF counsellors were engaging in acts of passive and active corruption including
             trading in influence, organised crime, and money laundering.
                  In March 2014, the RFB learned that the Federal Police had received the same complaint
             and established “Operation Zelotes” – a joint tax force consisting of the RFB, Federal Police,
             and Prosecution Office to investigate the allegations. To facilitate the task force’s work, the
             Police applied for a court order to override tax secrecy legislation and enable the RFB to share
             information with the Police and Prosecution.

                Box 5.3. Examples of effective reporting and information sharing between
                     tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities – Brazil (continued)
                 By the second half of 2014, the task force had formed serious suspicions of corruption
            within the CARF and invited the administrative unit responsible for internal control and
            corruption prevention activities within the Ministry of Finance to join the task force. Again,
            a judicial order was requested to ensure that all relevant information, including taxpayer
            information, could be shared among the relevant agencies. Eventually, a centre of operations
            was set up within the RFB where investigators from each agency could work together in one
            place.
                 The investigation revealed that several CARF counsellors were corrupted into altering
            decisions relating to more than USD 150 million in tax penalties. The investigation was carried
            out in nine stages and resulted in:
                 •   Twelve administrative proceedings by the internal control unit of the Ministry of
                     Finance aimed at dismissing all individuals suspected of corruption
                 •   Four administrative proceedings
                 •   Thirteen judicial proceedings
                 •   Two judicial misconduct proceedings
                 •   Ten convictions in the Court of First Instance
                 •   Fifteen auditing proceedings by the RFB resulting in penalties of more than
                     USD 150 million.
                 •   Overall, the case demonstrates the effective use of legal and operational frameworks
                     for information sharing, together with the successful creation of a joint task force (see
                     Chapter 7).
                 Operation Lava Jato (Car Wash)
                 In 2014, the Brazilian Federal Police and public prosecutors announced a formal
            investigation into Brazilian majority-state-owned oil company, Petrobras. Commonly known as
            “Operation Lava Jato” (Car Wash), it is widely regarded as the largest corruption investigation
            in Brazil’s history. It is alleged that approximately USD 3 billion in bribes were paid in Brazil
            and other parts of the world in relation to this complex corruption scheme. Petrobras executives
            allegedly approved contracts with companies and inflated the contracts to pay themselves and
            to establish a slush fund to bribe politicians and political parties.
                 Operation Lava Jato has resulted in charges against dozens of company executives, public
            officials, and politicians for corruption, racketeering, money laundering, and organised crime.
            The Brazilian authorities have secured convictions against many offenders, including senior
            politicians. To date there have been:
                 •   72 criminal cases against 289 individuals
                 •   182 sentences imposed on 118 individuals, totalling 1809 years in prison sentences
                 •   USD 3.5 billion in recovered assets, and
                 •   USD 3.7 billion in tax penalties.
                 Criminal investigations and prosecutions are ongoing in Brazil and elsewhere (including
            Switzerland and the United States). Brazil explains that civil tax auditors have worked closely
            with criminal corruption investigators and prosecutors since the early stages of Operation Lava
            Jato. The role of tax auditors has included analysing the tax and customs data of suspects. They

                 Box 5.3. Examples of effective reporting and information sharing between
                      tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities – Brazil (continued)
            have managed to uncover evidence of money laundering, tax evasion, and hidden assets, and
            to track financial flows. For example, the civil tax authority identified the purchase of a luxury
            car by the daughter of a former director of Petrobras. The analysis of the invoice showed a
            connection with an operator of the corruption scheme, who the director had denied knowing.
            Further analysis of the director showed that he was the beneficial owner of an offshore
            company that owned a luxurious apartment where the operator once lived. As another example,
            the tax authority identified bribe payments from construction companies to front companies
            that had been concealed through false consultancy contracts.
                 Overall, the civil tax authority has supported the entire investigation by providing relevant
            tax information and specialised analysis in the context of the broader objectives of the
            investigation.

                                                          Training
         109. This chapter is focused on benefits that can be attained from training tax examiners
         and auditors to detect corruption red flags and on training corruption investigators to detect
         indicators of tax crime. It provides guidance on the actual indicators that officials would
         be likely to come across in their ordinary activities. Training in this area is highly effective
         and efficient because it enables increased detection of tax crime and corruption simply by
         utilising the established roles of tax and corruption officials and the information already
         available to them. For this reason, countries are encouraged to consider including this type
         of training in the core curriculum for tax examiners/auditors, tax crime investigators, and
         corruption investigators.
         110. The majority of the countries included in this report provide anti-corruption officials
         with some training on the indicators of tax crime. Training tax officials on the indicators
         of potential corruption is even more common, with almost all countries providing some
         training. Many countries use the OECD Bribery and Corruption Awareness Handbook
         for Tax Examiners and Tax Auditors as a key training resource for tax officials. That
         Handbook provides detailed guidance to tax administration personnel on how to recognise
         indicators of possible bribery and corruption that they may come across in the course of
         regular tax examinations and tax audits. Tax officials are strongly encouraged to refer to
         that Handbook, which expands on the indicators of corruption that are summarised in this
         chapter.
         111. This chapter begins with a brief explanation of why training is an essential element
         of effective co-operation. Subsequent sections are separated into training tax officials on
         the indicators of potential corruption, training anti-corruption officials on the indicators
         of potential tax crime, methods of training delivery, and instruction on what to do if an
         indicator is identified.
Why training is an essential element of effective co-operation
         112. Programmes to train tax examiners and auditors on the indicators of corruption, and
         programmes to train corruption investigators on the indicators of tax crime, are essential
         elements of effective co-operation for several reasons. Awareness of the key indicators
         of tax crime or corruption enables officials to identify something suspicious and report
         it to the other authority in accordance with domestic law and subject to any applicable
         restrictions.
         113. In addition, training programmes that involve direct interaction between personnel
         of tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities – for example a joint training exercise or
         where an official from one authority trains a group of officials from the other – provide
         an important opportunity for relationship building and collective problem solving. These

"69","68 – 6. Training
          programmes allow officials to build professional networks, and to exchange and learn from
          each other’s experiences in dealing with common problems. They also allow for greater
          awareness and understanding of the activities of other authorities, including the types of
          misconduct they are responsible for investigating.
Training tax officials on the indicators of potential corruption
          114. A tax examiner or auditor may identify indicators of corruption at various stages.
          Indicators may be present in the compliance risk analysis process for selecting cases,
          during the examination of a tax return, planning a tax audit and during the audit itself.
          When considering possible indicators, tax examiners and auditors must think very broadly.
          Almost any unusual or unexplained feature of a taxpayer’s business, financial records or
          personal finances (or those of close relatives of the taxpayer) that is significant may be an
          indicator of possible corruption. This should prompt the examiner or auditor to pay extra
          attention to other possible indicators and to interrogate whether a tax deduction has been
          improperly claimed for a corrupt payment. It may also prompt referral of the suspicion
          to the appropriate corruption investigation authority, public prosecutor, or FIU (or a
          combination of these authorities).
          115. The indictors of potential corruption that tax officials should be trained to identify
          are summarised in Table 6.1. Each indicator is further explained in the text after the table
          and a more detailed examination can be found in the OECD Bribery and Corruption
          Awareness Handbook for Tax Auditors and Tax Examiners.

                                                                                 Indicators
           External risk environment      • Operating in a high corruption-risk country or industry
                                          • Operating in a highly regulated sector
           Internal risk environment      • Legal structures or connections that could be exploited for corrupt purposes
                                          • A company with weak internal controls
                                          • History of corruption offences
           Transactions                   • Transactions that are unusual in the context of the ordinary activities of the taxpayer
                                          • Transactions involving certain parties
                                          • Transactions involving suspicious terms
           Payments and money flows       • Payments or money flows with an unusual or unclear source/destination
                                          • Payments with suspicious terms
           Outcomes of transactions       • Transactions that result in unusual or unexplained benefits to the taxpayer’s business
                                          • Unusual outcomes concerning financial records or assets
           Receiving a bribe              • Receiving a bribe or the proceeds of corruption
          116. Corruption indicators concerning the external and internal risk environment of
          a taxpayer may be present at the earliest stage of a tax examination when the examiner or
          auditor is becoming familiar with the taxpayer’s business or industry. A clearer picture
          of the corruption red flags will emerge after thorough review of the taxpayer’s business
          environment, premises and records, and by understanding key decision makers in a
          business, such as those who authorise contracts and payments, and their relationship to
          other stakeholders. Through this process, an examiner or auditor trained in corruption red
          flags will identify weak controls and opportunities for corruption.

         117. Red flags in the external risk environment arise where an individual or company
         operates in a high corruption-risk country, such as those that score poorly on the
         Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 1 or Bribe Payers Index 2, or high
         corruption-risk industry, such as construction, extractive, transportation and storage,
         information and communication, and manufacturing. Highly regulated sectors, or sectors
         that require government authorisations and licences, such as extractives or energy, are also
         risky because of the high degree of interaction between public and private actors.
         118. In the internal risk environment, certain legal structures or connections can be
         exploited for corrupt purposes. A complex corporate structure with no apparent commercial,
         legal, or tax benefit is a red flag for corruption. Owning or controlling a legal entity with no
         commercial purpose or employing/interacting with politically exposed persons is another.
         Weak internal controls for the prevention of corruption could allow owners or managers of
         a business to pay bribes without detection, which includes lax anti-corruption policies, poor
         internal audit function or a lack of due diligence in hiring consultants. Further, a history of
         corruption offences, or attempts to undermine or influence the tax examination or audit, is
         another key corruption indicator.
         119. Unusual transactions are those that do not fit with the taxpayer’s ordinary activities,
         background or circumstances, have no logical economic or practical explanation, or where
         the origin or destination of funds is unclear. The existence of certain parties to transactions
         may also indicate possible corruption, for example if a party has no clear identity; is an
         agent, consultant, politically exposed person (PEP) 3, or a company related to a PEP; is
         unusual in the taxpayer’s industry, or is a foreign company or intermediary, particularly if
         based in a high corruption-risk country. Transactions involving suspicious terms, such as
         contracts with no underlying documentation, vague terms, or no reasonable commercial
         basis, are a further indicator of corruption that may be detected during a tax audit.
         120. Payments and money flows between parties to a bribery or corrupt transaction
         are often disguised as legitimate business payments and thus capable of being detected
         by auditors and examiners. An unusual or unclear payment source or destination may
         indicate a corrupt purpose in a wide range of circumstances. These circumstances include
         payments connected to a high corruption risk country or one with bank secrecy rules, an
         unidentified person or unidentified beneficial owner, a bank account or an intermediary in
         a third country, a PEP, or an entity that did not appear to take part in the projects linked to
         the payment. Payments with suspicious terms generally stand out because they do not fit the
         taxpayer’s usual profile. These may include unusually high or frequent payments; deviation
         from normal approval procedures; vague contractual terms or the absence of a written
         contract; unscheduled payments; disproportionate income for the goods or services provided;
         excessive payments made to an intermediary or consultant; or payments to an unknown
         beneficial owner. Other corruption indicators concerning payments and money flows
         include significant, unexplained cash withdrawals; frequently opening and closing bank
         accounts; payments that are not recorded in financial records; and unexplained payments.
         121. The outcomes of transactions can also indicate red flags for corruption. Tax
         officials should look out for transactions that result in benefits to the taxpayer’s business,
         such as favourable treatment by government agencies; unusually high success rate of
         winning contracts; and contracts or other benefits granted by PEPs or their relatives, or
         awarded without public tender. There are also a wide range of outcomes that impact
         financial records or assets that might indicate corruption. These include key financial
         ratios inconsistent with similar businesses, unusual or unexplained losses or profits on
         contracts, expenses that are not linked to sales or profits, unexplained loans, or transactions

          resulting in luxury assets acquired by the company, or a taxpayer whose income does not
          support their lifestyle or spending pattern.
          122. Most of the indicators of corrupt payments are also indicators that a person has
          received a bribe or proceeds of corruption on the other side of the transaction. Tax
          examiners and auditors should be aware that bribe recipients may seek to hide the payments
          they receive or disguise them as legitimate income. Indicators that are particularly relevant
          to the receipt of a corrupt payment include where a person: is a public official in a high
          corruption risk country; is responsible for public procurement or granting authorisations or
          licences; has unexplained growth in net wealth or unexplained cash spending.
Training anti-corruption officials on the indicators of potential tax crime
          123. Anti-corruption officials may come across indicators of tax crime at any stage in
          the process of detecting, investigating, or prosecuting a corruption case. When considering
          possible indicators, corruption investigators should be aware that many indicators of
          corruption are also indicators of tax crime. Almost every bribery transaction is likely to
          involve tax evasion – by the bribe payer who claims a tax deduction for the payment, or
          the bribe recipient who fails to declare the income in their tax declaration. Concealed or
          otherwise suspicious financial transactions or legal arrangements may also be an indicator
          of tax crime. These should prompt the anti-corruption official to pay close attention to other
          possible indicators of tax crime and consider a referral of the suspicion to the appropriate
          tax authority, tax crime investigation authority, or prosecutor.
          124. The indictors of potential tax evasion and tax crime that anti-corruption officials
          should be trained to identify are summarised in Table 6.2. Each indicator is further
          explained in the text after the table.

           Receiving a bribe                    • Receiving a corrupt payment
          125. In any investigation, a corruption investigator needs to understand the business
          environment surrounding an individual or organisation suspected of corruption, and how
          that suspect conducts its business operations. Accordingly, corruption investigators routinely
          gather information on the risk environment of a suspect. While this information would
          generally include many of the tax crime indicators mentioned above, specific training in
          tax crime indicators concerning the external and internal risk environment enables
          corruption investigators to identify opportunities and higher risk situations for tax crime.

         126. Tax crime red flags in the external risk environment are present where a business
         operates in an industry with high commercial risk or an individual taxpayer is otherwise
         under significant financial strain. These pressures may compel a person to evade taxes or
         make false claims for tax deductions. Industries and sectors subject to relatively high taxes
         or other duties, such as tobacco or extractives in some countries, are also risky because
         of the significant financial gains that follow tax evasion. The external risk environment
         may also provide opportunities to avoid paying tax, particularly where the collection of
         income tax or VAT relies on self-reporting by the taxpayer. These opportunities include
         businesses with a high volume of cash transactions and those that deal in high value and
         portable products, such as diamonds.
         127. In the internal risk environment, corruption investigators should be aware of
         certain legal structures that could be used to facilitate tax crime. A legal entity that
         appears to have no commercial purpose, a legal entity among a group that cannot be
         explained, or a company registered in a low tax or tax-secrecy jurisdiction outside of the
         place of residence of the suspect, could be vessels for tax evasion. 4 Business methods
         that could conceal income or facilitate tax crime include the use of foreign principals
         or foreign export companies, poor record keeping practices that disguise the purpose or
         destination of financial transactions, or sham agencies in which the suspect company
         purports to be independent of the principal when in reality it is under common ownership
         or control. A family trust or other legal structure may have been established to obscure
         the connection between the company and the principal. Further, a history of tax evasion
         or tax crime or the failure to file a tax declaration are another set of key indicators of tax
         crime risk in a suspects internal risk environment.
         128. Corruption investigators routinely identify unusual, suspicious or corrupt transactions
         that have or may have a connection to tax crime. A common example is bribe payments
         to domestic or foreign public officials, which are not tax deductible in most countries.
         Another red flag for tax crime is a payment to a public official that is not part of their
         normal income stream, such as cash, lavish gifts or luxury travel. The official may
         incur a tax liability for such payments even if corruption, in the form of a quid pro quo
         for the payment, cannot be proven. The risk of tax crime is magnified if the official who
         received the payment works for the revenue or tax authority and has power to influence tax
         assessments or to approve tax relief/reimbursement. Assets that have not been declared
         to the tax authority, for example they appear to be concealed in the books and records
         of a company, are another tax crime indicator since there is likely to be a tax reporting
         obligation regarding the asset itself or the return on the asset. A further set of suspicious
         transactions are those involving foreign or hidden accounts that a corruption investigator
         suspects were used to transmit or hold bribe payments, or that hold funds that cannot be
         explained considering the official’s income. The existence of such accounts, or duplicate
         separate accounts for the same business, may indicate tax evasion.
         129. Corruption investigators should be aware that certain outcomes of transactions
         may indicate red flags for tax crime. If an investigator’s analysis reveals that a company
         permanently runs at a loss, it may indicate uncommercial trading and a control
         relationship with suppliers or customers of the company that may be manipulated to evade
         tax. Unusual outcomes may include paying significantly more than market value for an
         asset, which could indicate a person is inflating the value of business expenses. Transactions
         should also be clearly and properly recorded in a company’s books and records. Destroyed
         or incomplete records may indicate an attempt to conceal tax crime.

          130. Finally, the receipt of a corrupt payment would, in many countries, trigger a tax
          liability. A public official or company officer who receives a bribe, embezzles funds or
          otherwise collects a corrupt payment is unlikely to have declared it to the tax authority in
          violation of domestic tax laws.
Methods for delivering training
          131. Authorities use a wide variety of methods for delivering training to tax officials on
          corruption indicators and to corruption investigators on tax crime indicators. The most
          effective approaches are those that systematically and routinely target all relevant officials
          and cover, at a minimum, the indicators set out in this report and the OECD Bribery and
          Corruption Awareness Handbook for Tax Auditors and Tax Examiners. Training of this
          nature should generally involve officials from both the tax and anti-corruption authority,
          or be led by an expert from one authority who trains a group from the other.
          132. The delivery methods developed by both countries and multilateral organisations
          target the full range of officials, from new recruits to experienced officers. A selection of
          good practices for training methods is set out below to enable authorities to consider and
          adopt the most appropriate and effective methods for their circumstances.

                                  • Examples include the Netherlands, where FIOD provides basic training for corruption
                                    investigators that includes tax crime investigations, and Singapore, where CPIB officers
                                    are trained on the indicators of tax crime in the Corrupt Practices Investigation Officer Basic
                                    Course and in periodic in-service training
                                  • In Israel, all new tax examiners receive targeted training sessions on the topic of corruption
                                    and bribery as part of the preliminary training, which is in addition to annual training sessions
                                    held by the Israeli Tax Authority for all its investigative offices
           In-service training    • In-service training or professional development courses are often taught by experienced tax
           or professional          or corruption investigators
           development courses    • Such may be provided to officials at any career stage
                                  • A common and effective model is for one authority to organise training for the other in the form
                                    of a workshop, seminar, or conference
                                  • In Slovenia, this occurs on the basis of a written agreement between the revenue and policy
                                    authority
                                  • In Canada, the RCMP’s new money laundering and proceeds of crime training course (taken
                                    by corruption investigators) includes a module delivered by CRA tax investigators
                                  • In jurisdictions where the same authority is responsible for both corruption and tax crime
                                    investigations, such as France and Italy, it can be mandatory for officials to receive training in
                                    the indicators of both tax crime and corruption

          Additional ad hoc training • Additional ad hoc training is particularly important to enable officials to keep abreast of
                                       relevant developments
                                     • For example, when new corruption or tax offences are introduced, new investigative powers
                                       are granted, or the processes or rules regarding information sharing are changed
          Handbooks and manuals      • Handbooks and manuals are a key source of information regarding practical measures to

                                       their own domestic handbooks for tax examiners and corruption investigators, as appropriate
                                     • For example, Brazil’s tax authority has included in its auditing manuals detailed information
                                       for tax auditors to detect and handle suspicions of bribery and corruption; it also encourages
                                       the use of the OECD Bribery and Corruption Awareness Handbook for Tax Auditors and Tax
                                       Examiners, which is made available in Portuguese, and has incorporated that Handbook’s key
                                       themes into its own auditing manual
                                     • Other materials, whether in hardcopy or electronic, can be used to deliver key information
                                       and to supplement active training. This includes brochures, circulars, newsletters, pamphlets,
                                       emails, and e-learning modules
          Recruitment of             • Recruiting officials who have worked in anti-corruption or tax authorities and have experience
          experienced officials        in detecting indicators is an effective method for training other staff

                                       crime and corruption, as occurs in Georgia
                                     • This helps to determine whether training has been sufficiently wide-reaching and routine year

Training officials on what to do when an indicator is identified
         133. Staff training is essential to reinforcing an agency’s stance on reporting and
         information sharing, including the procedures that must be followed. It is important that
         all relevant tax and anti-corruption officials are aware of their obligations with respect
         to reporting and information sharing. Officials need to have a clear understanding of
         what to do once an indicator of possible corruption or tax crime is identified and officials
         responsible for handling requests for information from other authorities should understand
         their obligations, and the importance of information sharing to the extent they may
         exercise discretion. The content of training or guidance on this issue will depend on the
         particular legal framework in which the authorities operate. In general, it should explain the
         operation of the law, including whether reporting and information sharing are mandatory
         or discretionary (or prohibited), and whether further steps must be taken before the
         information can be shared (for example, obtaining a court order or formal request from the
         other authority). Officials should also be informed about the relevant procedures to follow
         from the point at which a suspicion is identified, including any internal approval processes,
         contact points in the other authority, and the form and manner in which information is to
         be shared (see Chapters 3 and 5 for more information).

                                                         Chapter 7
                                      Joint operations and taskforces
         134. This chapter examines how joint operations and taskforces (collectively “joint
         investigations”) can enhance domestic co-operation between tax crime and anti-corruption
         authorities. Joint investigations are used frequently and with significant success in several
         countries. Where appropriate, authorities are encouraged to adopt or enhance their use of
         such measures and this chapter is designed to assist in this regard.
         135. The first part of this chapter discusses the role of joint operations and taskforces in
         tackling tax crime and corruption. It explains the differences between these two types of
         enhanced collaboration, explores the various bases on which joint investigations may be
         formed, and demonstrates their versatility. The practical benefits of joint operations and
         taskforces, as reported by countries that have experience using them, are examined in the
         second part. The third part considers challenges posed by joint operations and taskforces.
         The chapter concludes with a summary of good practices and three examples of real world
         joint operations and taskforces that have successfully addressed tax crime and corruption.
The role joint operations and taskforces play in tackling tax crime and corruption
         136. Joint investigation teams are formed for the purposes of a specific joint operation or
         case, or structured as a permanent or long-term taskforce. Joint operations are distinct from
         taskforces in that they are formed on an ad-hoc, case by case, basis with no permanency.
         They are used to maximise enforcement outcomes in a particular case. Taskforces, on the
         other hand, are permanent or long-term arrangements that handle multiple cases and may
         address issues in addition to investigations, such as intelligence gathering and analysis
         and strategy setting. They are generally used to target cases that fall within a particular
         category of offending, such as organised crime or widespread tax evasion schemes.
         137. Joint investigations take many different forms, reflecting the particular legal or
         institutional framework of the country in which they operate and the purpose for which
         they were established. Thus, their organisation may differ from country to country, and
         within a country depending on the needs of the case. However, regardless of form, the
         fundamental role of any joint team in any country is to provide a mechanism for more
         efficient and effective co-operation between authorities. A significant number of countries
         participating in this report have identified joint operations and taskforces as important tools
         for combating tax crime and corruption. It appears that the role of these tools is growing as
         more enforcement authorities grapple with the increasing complexity of economic crime
         and the particular interplay between tax crime and corruption.
         138. The legal basis for forming joint operations varies from country to country.
         Joint operation teams enable tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities to work
         together on a particular investigation. The following examples show the basis on which

"77","76 – 7. Joint operations and taskforces
           joint operations involving investigators of both tax and corruption have been established in
           practice, including where special legislation was necessary to allow joint operations:
                •   By simple agreement between investigative authorities. For example, in Brazil,
                    there are no clear legislative rules to establish joint task forces for performing
                    investigations, but the use of such operations is supported by the superior court.
                    In practice, they are established by a simple agreement between authorities and
                    subject to judicial authorisation. In Portugal, the Tax and Customs Administration
                    and criminal police are able to form joint investigation teams to work on complex
                    investigations involving tax and non-tax offences. Typically, a team will include
                    tax officials dealing with tax issues arising from the analysis of accounting and
                    financial records and documents, and police officers dealing mainly with arrests,
                    searches and phone tapping.
                •   Under the authority of the public prosecutor. In Austria, the public prosecutor
                    may authorise joint police and tax authority investigations into major cases of
                    corruption and social or economic fraud. In Georgia, the Prosecution Service
                    undertakes overall co-ordination and supervision of criminal investigations and the
                    decision to form a joint investigation is made by the Deputy Chief Prosecutor. To
                    support this process and further facilitate inter-agency co-operation in Georgia, the
                    Chief Prosecutor has entered into an MOU with other agency heads, under which
                    a special Inter-Agency Co-operation Council was created. In Hungary, legislation
                    exists to allow agencies to establish joint investigation teams. This requires an
                    agreement to be drawn up by the heads of the participating authorities, which must
                    be approved by the public prosecutor. Legislation introduced in Slovenia in 2009
                    allows multi-agency teams to be brought together to work on investigations, under
                    the direction of the State Prosecutor’s Office. The composition of these teams
                    varies depending on the demands of the case, and can include officials from the
                    tax administration, customs administration, police, and other agencies, as required.
                •   Under the authority of a special body. In Greece, the Office of Action and
                    Business Planning Co-ordination has been established, pursuant to law and a
                    Presidential Decree, in the General Secretary Against Corruption, allowing
                    the Minister of Justice to act as operational leader for the co-ordination of joint
                    operations between the Financial Police Division, Financial and Economic Crime
                    Unit, and other inspection bodies.
           139. Parallel investigations are different to joint operations. In a parallel investigation,
           authorities co-ordinate some investigative activities but carry out separate investigations.
           They generally involve a lower level of co-operation between authorities but may be useful
           in certain circumstances, as discussed in the Chapter 8.
           140. Multi-agency taskforces are formed as permanent or semi-permanent structures
           or to pursue multiple cases. They tend to be established when co-operation among
           particular authorities is expected to be necessary or beneficial in each case and may extend
           to supporting a co-ordinated approach to the prevention and detection of crime, as well as
           to its investigation. The examples of economic crime taskforces identified for this report
           demonstrate their versatile application to a range of issues, including:
                •   Institute a whole of government approach to combating organised crime and
                    terrorism. The Multi-Agency Team Framework established in Kenya brings
                    together a host of authorities including the Office of the President, Ethics and Anti-
                    Corruption Commission, Director of Public Prosecutions, Directorate of Criminal
                    Investigations, National Intelligence Service, Financial Reporting Centre, Asset

                  Recovery Agency and Kenya Revenue Authority. The framework focuses on
                  co-operation for the investigation and prosecution of corruption, economic crime,
                  and organised crime. Under this framework, in appropriate cases, some or all of
                  these agencies conduct joint investigations.
              •   Respond to data leaks such as the “Panama Papers”. In 2016, the United Kingdom
                  established a multi-agency taskforce to deal with intelligence following the release of
                  the so-called “Panama Papers”. The Taskforce has advanced the United Kingdom’s
                  understanding of the complex and contrived structures that are being developed
                  to mask offshore tax evasion and economic crime, and. as set out in Box 7.1, the
                  taskforce has already produced a number of successful results.
                        Box 7.1. Establishment of a multi-agency taskforce to deal with
                                       the Panama Papers – United Kingdom
                 The cross-agency Taskforce established in response to the Panama Papers included
            secondees from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the Serious Fraud Office, the
            National Crime Agency, and the Financial Conduct Authority. HMRC reports that work on the
            Panama papers has resulted in a number of ongoing enforcement actions including civil and
            criminal investigations into over 140 individuals for suspected tax offences. It also notes that
            the Taskforce has also acted as a catalyst for uniting closer and wider inter-agency co-operation
            both domestically and internationally. HMRC reflects that its participation on the Taskforce
            has enabled it to better understand offshore tax evasion and economic crime activities. For
            example, it now knows much more about the role and behaviours of company formation agents
            in facilitating offshore evasion. HMRC continues to work collaboratively ‎ with international
            colleagues through other legal mechanisms. For example, a new alliance dedicated to tackling
            international tax crime and money laundering known as the J5, which includes government
            agencies from Australia, the United States, the Netherlands, Canada and the United Kingdom.
              •   Co-ordinate co-operation between the tax authority and police at the national
                  and regional levels to combat tax crime. In the Czech Republic, in 2014, the
                  Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior made an agreement on co-operation,
                  information sharing, and co-ordination in combating tax evasion and tax crime with
                  the ultimate aim of protecting the state budget. The Financial Authority (national and
                  regional arms), Customs Administration (national General Directorate of Customs
                  and regional offices of customs administration) and the police (National Organised
                  Crime Agency, Financial Crime Command, Tax Crime Division and the economic
                  crime divisions of regional police directorates) co‑operate under this agreement
                  in what is known as the Tax Cobra Strategy. It is a permanent arrangement that
                  facilitates reciprocal exchanges of information and co-ordinates efforts to fight tax
                  crime utilising the skills of tax officials and police (including those responsible for
                  economic crimes such as corruption). Formal meetings of management are held
                  monthly and discuss overarching strategic issues, assess joint activities and identify
                  cases for joint investigation. Informal, working level meetings in specific cases
                  occur as needed. The Strategy focuses on serious cases of tax crime and other related
                  criminal activity that supports it, such as corruption.

                   prosecutors, tax and customs administration, and the Comptroller General are
                   regularly established and used to investigate tax crime and corruption.
               •   Combat organised crime through tax and anti-corruption enforcement. In
                   Israel, a unit dedicated to the fight against organised crime (referred to by its
                   acronym “Yahalom” – the Hebrew word for diamond) was established in 2011
                   within the tax administration’s Investigations Unit and is composed of tax authority
                   investigators and members of the Israeli Police. This designated investigative unit
                   of the tax authority is intended to focus its intelligence gathering and investigatory
                   efforts on financial offences, including, inter alia, bribery, forgery, and false
                   invoices in which criminal organisations may be involved or implicated. It was
                   created pursuant to a 2007 Government Decision on combating organised crime. A
                   wide range of investigative techniques are at Yahalom’s disposal so as to ensure the
                   unit has all the tools and techniques necessary to perform its tasks.
               •   Co-ordinate the fight against financial crime. The Malaysian National Revenue
                   Recovery Enforcement Team (NRRET) works to combat tax crimes and other
                   financial crimes and is headed by the Attorney General Chambers. NRRET
                   members include Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia, the Company Commission
                   Malaysia, Central Bank of Malaysia, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and
                   Royal Customs Department. The role of the NRRET is to improve co-operation
                   among law enforcement authorities to ensure a holistic approach on development,
                   good governance and anti-corruption as well as to assist authorities in combating
                   financial crimes, and in particular tax evasion and money laundering. The
                   NRRET also monitors the sharing of information and the planning of joint
                   operations between authorities. In Australia, the multi-agency Serious Financial
                   Crime Taskforce includes the AFP, ATO, and several other intelligence, policy,
                   enforcement, and regulatory agencies. It has operational, intelligence, and reform
                   functions, and is explained further in the examples below.
Benefits of joint operations and taskforces
           141. Countries that have experience using joint operations or taskforces report significant
           benefits with respect to both tax crime and corruption investigations. Looking across the
           practices and experiences of all countries participating in this report, the major benefits of
           joint operations and taskforces can be grouped as follows:
               •   increased enforcement capacity
               •   broader set of investigative powers, tools, and offenses
               •   sharing of resources
               •   de-conflicting enforcement action
               •   undertaking simultaneous action
               •   enhancing information sharing, and
               •   increasing deterrence.

         (i) Increased enforcement capacity
         142. When corruption and tax crime investigation authorities come together in a joint
         operation or taskforce, their strength and capacity is increased because the field of inquiry is
         expanded and the level of expertise applied to it is broadened. Joint operations and taskforces
         can multiply the strength and capacity of an investigation by enabling separate authorities
         to capitalise on each other’s unique expertise, skills, technical knowledge, investigative
         techniques, and investigative powers. Working together in this way is particularly relevant
         to investigations into misconduct that span offences against tax and anti-corruption law. For
         example, a bribery scheme in which the bribe payments are incorrectly claimed by the bribe
         payer as tax deductible or not declared by the bribe recipient contrary to tax obligations.
         This form of co-operation can have significant positive implications for joint strategic
         intelligence and for setting a strategy to optimise law enforcement outcomes. Regarding
         intelligence, for example, the tax investigator may see in a financial statement evidence of
         a tax crime not immediately apparent to a corruption investigator. Similarly, a corruption
         investigator may suggest charging an offence that would not have been in the mind of the
         tax investigator.
         143. This form of joint approach is highly beneficial to tackling complex financial crime
         schemes, which often involve tax crime and corruption. It allows investigators to work
         together to unpack multiple financial transactions, examine multiple corporations and
         individuals involved in the scheme, determine where the evidence more clearly indicates
         one type of crime over another, and set the case strategy appropriately. The joint approach
         may also be applicable to more simple cases of tax crime and corruption, particularly
         a group of related cases. Israel explains that it uses joint operations regularly because
         “There is notable improvement in the quality of information and its diversification as
         well as the quality of ‘cracking’ cases. Co-operation has brought multiplication of power.
         Each enforcement authority has a relative advantage in terms of thinking and in its nature
         of exercising authority. Combining these differences improves enforcement and creates
         enhanced ‘deterrence’.”
         (ii) Broader set of investigative powers, tools and offences.
         144. As discussed in Chapter 4, tax crime investigators have specialised knowledge of
         financial and tax arrangements. They are trained and experienced in investigating tax
         crimes and familiar with identifying these types of offences in the tax returns, books, or
         records of companies and individuals. They generally have the power to charge offences
         or recommend charges relating to the tax code of a country. On the other hand, corruption
         investigators are familiar with corruption schemes, perhaps involving bribery of domestic
         or foreign public officials, bribery in the private sector, embezzlement, misappropriation
         of property by a public official, trading in influence, abuse of functions, illicit enrichment
         or money laundering. Corruption investigators may charge offences or recommend charges
         pursuant to corruption offences in a country’s criminal law. Joint investigations more
         readily enable investigators to identify tax and corruption offences and thus make tactical
         decisions about which charges they want to advance based on litigation speed and potential
         outcomes. This, in turn, reduces tensions that stem from potential conflicts concerning
         deliverables and statistics.

"81","80 – 7. Joint operations and taskforces
           (iii) Sharing of resources and de-conflicting enforcement action.
           145. Joint operations and taskforces also achieve greater efficiency by allowing the
           sharing of resources and ensuring no duplication of enforcement efforts. For example, one
           authority may have analytical software that would not otherwise be available to the other
           except in the context of the joint work. Joint efforts also promote better co-ordination
           between authorities, thus reducing the risk of different enforcement actions by separate
           authorities coming into conflict with each other. Efficiency is further increased by enabling
           officials from each agency to focus on different aspects of an investigation in a well-co-
           ordinated manner, based on their experience and legal powers.
           (iv) Simultaneous actions.
           146. Joint operations allow for the sharing of information and intelligence on a real-time
           basis and enable authorities to conduct co-ordinated simultaneous actions, such as asset
           freezing or recovery, search and seizure, surveillance, charging, and prosecution.
           (v) Enhanced information sharing
           147. Joint operations also promote better information sharing, although there may be
           restrictions placed on information that is shared between authorities during an investigation.
           Better information sharing occurs in joint investigations by virtue of investigators working
           more closely with each other. A tax investigator may more readily identify where tax
           records and bank account/asset information could assist a corruption investigation if the
           tax investigator is actually involved in the investigation. Similarly, the joint nature of the
           work may prompt a corruption investigator to share information gleaned from an earlier or
           separate ongoing investigation that is relevant to the joint operation. In some circumstances,
           joint operations or taskforces may even allow for wider gateways for sharing information
           between authorities than would ordinarily be available.
               Box 7.2. Examples of wider information sharing gateways in joint operations –
                                           Canada and the United States
                  In Canada, joint working arrangements such as Joint Forces Operation and Combined
             Forces Special Enforcement Unit (an integrated, multidisciplinary team that is tasked with
             investigating major crime in partnership with local, national and international agencies) provides
             the police with a means to share all information with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
             investigators, where such sharing would not otherwise be possible. For example, information
             obtained by police wiretap can be shared with the CRA under specific circumstances and
             can provide invaluable tax and financial information that otherwise would not be available to
             the CRA.
                  In the United States, the tax administration has greater power to share tax information
             with other law enforcement agencies when it is participating in a joint criminal investigation
             with these agencies. This information may not be shared with agencies outside of the joint
             investigation.

         (vi) Deterrence
         148. Joint operations and taskforces can achieve greater deterrence of tax crime and
         corruption. Greater deterrence is a function of more robust law enforcement activity and
         the joint public messaging that goes with it. The message that tax crime and corruption
         will be detected and robustly investigated and prosecuted can be far stronger when it comes
         from both the anti-corruption and tax authorities in the context of a joint operation or
         taskforce. Accordingly, effective public promotion of a successful major joint operation or
         taskforce is a powerful tool in awareness raising and deterring misconduct.
Challenges posed by joint operations and taskforces
         149. Joint operations and taskforces are not suited to every tax crime or corruption
         investigation for a number of reasons. In most minor cases, it is simply unnecessary and
         inefficient to consider this level of co-operation, unless a taskforce may help authorities
         deal with a number of similar or related cases. Further, setting up and running joint
         investigative work requires investment of time, resources, and potentially commitment
         of political will (for example to amend the law to allow wider gateways for information
         sharing). Although joint investigations may offer substantial cost savings, for example by
         avoiding duplicative investigative measures, they could also incur costs related to logistical
         and technical support and other administrative matters depending on the set up of the
         operation or taskforce. These considerations may be applied on a case-by-case basis.
         150. Several of the general challenges to improved co-operation mentioned in Chapter 5
         also apply to joint operations and taskforces. Some of these challenges, such as information
         sharing and issues of trust, are heightened in the particular context of joint work. Information
         sharing is a key consideration when setting up a joint operation or taskforce because the
         ability to share information freely is critical to success. In particular, any restrictive rules
         regarding information sharing should be identified early and may mean that a joint operation
         cannot be effectively established.
                         Box 7.3. Challenges posed by joint operations – South Africa
                 For example, in South Africa, law enforcement agencies frequently co-operate when
            investigating financial crimes through joint investigation teams, comprising specialists
            from each agency. However, the team would not generally include the tax administration. In
            cases where the tax administration does assign tax officials to joint investigation teams, the
            official is unable to use any special legislative powers held by virtue of their position as a tax
            administration employee. More often, where suspected criminal activities include tax and non-
            tax offences, the tax administration does co-operate with other agencies by running its own
            parallel investigation and sharing information with the joint investigation team.
         151. The need for authorities to trust each other is another challenge that must be dealt
         with in the joint investigation setting. In the absence of trust, the joint investigation is likely
         to fail. Trust may be difficult to establish where, for example, an authority is concerned
         about a partner authority’s independence or its ability or willingness to follow proper
         procedures, protect confidential information or to use information appropriately.

"83","82 – 7. Joint operations and taskforces
           152. Countries have also identified that working on a joint operation or taskforce may bring
           practical challenges. These include managing competing priorities between authorities;
           working among unfamiliar cultural, technical, or structural surrounds; and reaching
           agreement on key aspects of a case as it develops, for example setting a shared investigation
           strategy or deciding which charges to bring in a particular case. A related challenge that
           may be particular to developing countries is resource and capacity imbalance between their
           authorities. For example, if a tax investigation authority has far greater resources than a police
           authority (e.g. for investigations, support staff, training, technical resources etc.) – forming a
           joint operation could be particularly difficult.
Successful processes for establishing joint operations
           153. The following are a set of processes for effectively establishing joint operations and
           taskforces in the fight against tax crime and corruption that have proven successful in
           several jurisdictions. These examples are based on the country experiences examined for
           this report and discussed earlier in this chapter. Authorities interested in participating in a
           joint operation or taskforce to combat tax crime and corruption should:
               •   Determine whether there is an adequate legal basis. Consider, for example,
                   whether an explicit legislative basis for establishing a joint investigation exists and, if
                   not, whether one is required. It may be necessary to amend legislation in this regard.
               •   Identify the legal gateway for information sharing. The ability to share
                   information freely between authorities is an important feature of successful joint
                   operations and taskforces. Existing rules may need to be amended to provide
                   for this and procedures put in place to ensure taxpayer rights are protected and
                   information is exchanged lawfully.
               •   Examine practical issues. Key topics to examine include the relevant differences
                   in each authority’s approach to investigations and prosecutions. What informs
                   the investigation strategy and what investigative steps are given priority? How
                   are targets prioritised? How are charging decisions made? When are suspects
                   confronted and what steps are taken to avoid tipping them off? As part of this
                   discussion, authorities should also identify shared goals and priorities as well
                   as any competing interests. Naturally, tax authorities are more likely to support
                   the joint operation pursuing tax evasion and anti-corruption authorities pursuing
                   the corruption. Beyond these issues, authorities may also have different strategic
                   interests, for example priority targets based on sectors or particular types of
                   misconduct. All of these issues should be identified and discussed early and
                   measures adopted to mitigate them. Other practical issues for discussion include
                   internal management and approval structures, legal procedures, sharing of costs,
                   evidence preservation measures and dispute resolution mechanisms.
               •   Consider the extent to which arrangements should be formalised in writing. For
                   example, through an overarching memorandum of understanding or a case specific
                   agreement. The structure of the arrangement may be tailored in any number of ways
                   to meet the needs of the participating authorities and to fit the circumstances of the
                   investigation or taskforce. However, in general, the written agreement (if any) should
                   clearly define the roles of the participating authorities and the general purpose of the
                   joint investigation (noting that if the document could be discoverable, it should not
                   be drafted in a way that it would tip off targets). It could also address any liability
                   issues, such as who is financially liable if investigative measures give rise to claims
                   against the joint investigation for damages.

         154. Many countries are already using joint investigation teams and taskforces to
         enhance co-operation in the investigation of tax crime and corruption. 1 The following case
         examples from Australia and the United States help to demonstrate this trend and to show
         the real-life application of joint operations and taskforces.
                       Box 7.4. Successful multi-agency taskforce in practice – Australia
                 The Serious Financial Crime Taskforce (SFCT) is a multi-agency taskforce targeting
            Serious Financial Crime in Australia and builds on the success of Project Wickenby in
            addressing international tax evasion. The SFCT includes the AFP, the ATO, and several other
            intelligence, policy, enforcement and regulatory agencies. The heads of each Taskforce agency
            meet regularly to provide governance and focus for cross agency collaborative efforts.
                 The Taskforce forms part of the Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre, which is led by the
            AFP.* The Taskforce brings together the agencies’ strategic and operational level intelligence,
            capacity, and capability to identify and treat serious financial crime.
                 The SFCT focuses on operational activities, intelligence collection and sharing, and
            identifying and initiating reform measures. It works to remove wealth generated by criminal
            activity, including tax crime and corruption, and to prosecute facilitators and promoters of serious
            financial crime. Offences targeted by the SFCT relate to serious fraud, money laundering, and
            defrauding the Commonwealth. The current priorities include criminality related to international
            tax evasion, fraudulent phoenix activity, trusts, and superannuation.
                 The SFCT commenced on 1 July 2015 and is progressing 31 criminal, civil, and intelligence
            matters. The following is a snapshot of results to 30 June 2018:
                           •   137 search warrants executed
                           •   824 audits completed
                           •   7 prosecutions commenced
                           •   5 people convicted
                           •   AUD 599.34 million in tax liabilities raised
                           •   AUD 232.16 million recouped
            *See www.afp.gov.au/what-we-do/crime-types/fraud/fraud-and-anti-corruption.
                         Box 7.5. Successful joint operation in practice – United States
                 The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) corruption investigation is an
            example of a successful inter-agency co-operation in the United States, not only between tax
            authorities and anti-corruption authorities, but also with foreign law enforcement counterparts
            which provided valuable assistance. The 24-year scheme was investigated by IRS-Criminal
            Investigation (IRS-CI) along with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of
            Investigation (FBI). The scheme involved bribery, money laundering conspiracies, wire fraud,
            and other illicit activities among high ranking FIFA officials and corporate executives.

"85","84 – 7. Joint operations and taskforces
                  Box 7.5. Successful joint operation in practice – United States (continued)
                  The officials received bribes and kickbacks in exchange for votes to determine the host
             nation for world cup tournaments as well as votes to award lucrative contracts for media and
             marketing rights to international soccer tournaments. The payment of the bribes and kickbacks
             were disguised using various mechanisms such as fabrication and back dating of contracts
             to create an appearance of legitimacy for the illicit payments. Shell companies were formed
             and held offshore accounts to conceal the true source of the payments. Trusted intermediaries
             were used to facilitate the bribe payments. Nominees and numbered accounts were used and
             opened at countries known to be tax havens and at other secretive banking jurisdictions. The
             investigation has resulted in some guilty pleas of individuals involved. Charles Blazer, former
             member of the FIFA executive committee used his position for personal gain. Blazer failed to
             file U.S individual income tax returns for tax years 2005 through 2010, failed to pay income
             tax and engaged in affirmative acts of evasion. Blazer pleaded guilty to charges of, among
             others, income tax evasion and failure to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts.

                                                         Chapter 8
                                     Other co-ordination mechanisms
         155. This chapter presents additional mechanisms to enhance information sharing and
         other forms of co-operation between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities:
              •   Parallel investigations
              •   Other structured co-ordination fora
              •   Joint intelligence centres
              •   Staff secondments
              •   Reviewing the tax affairs of persons sanctioned for corruption
              •   Registers for the income and assets of public officials
         156. Each of these different co-ordination mechanisms advances co-operation between
         authorities in different ways. Parallel investigations are tools for promoting better
         co-ordination of operational activities. Other structured co-ordination fora are used to
         develop overarching capabilities and strategies of relevance to both tax authorities and
         anti-corruption authorities. Joint intelligence centres serve an operational function, but
         are focused specifically on the collection, analysis, and distribution of intelligence. Staff
         secondments enable individual officers to gain first-hand, on-the-job experience of the
         other authority and to strengthen professional networks. Calling on the tax authority to
         review the tax affairs of persons sanctioned for corruption ensures the financial benefits
         derived from corruption are stripped from offenders. Finally, registers for the income and
         assets of public officials (which in some countries are administered by the tax authority or
         anti-corruption authority) may be used to help detect tax crime or corruption and may hold
         other useful information for investigators.
Parallel investigations
         157. A parallel investigation enables two or more separate authorities to co-ordinate some
         key operational activities in cases that involve a combination of corruption, tax crime or
         other tax-related misconduct. While authorities work more closely in a joint operation;
         a parallel investigation may still allow a degree of co-ordination and may be a more
         appropriate vehicle for co-operation in circumstances where a joint operation would be
         impractical or undesirable, as discussed below.
         158. In a parallel investigation, tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities maintain
         their own separate investigations, but to the extent possible, co-ordinate their actions
         simultaneously. Parallel investigations differ from joint operations (see chapter 7) because
         they involve two or more separate sets of investigations under the management of separate
IMPROVING CO-OPERATION BETWEEN TAX AUTHORITIES AND ANTI-CORRUPTION AUTHORITIES IN COMBATING TAX CRIME AND CORRUPTION © OECD 2018

"87","86 – 8. Other co-ordination mechanisms
          regulatory or enforcement bodies. As such, parallel investigations involve a lower level
          of integration among the different investigative authorities. Depending on the level of
          co-ordination, authorities engaged in parallel investigations may (subject to applicable
          information sharing rules) share investigative leads, intelligence, and evidence, and
          interview witnesses and settle pleadings together. Parallel investigations may also allow
          authorities to make some operational decisions jointly, for example, dividing broad elements
          of an investigation and charging decisions.
          159. The decision to use a parallel investigation rather than a joint operation may have
          a genuine operational basis. For example, where the high level of co-ordination achieved
          by a joint investigation is unnecessary, or a joint investigation cannot be pursued because
          of requirements that civil and criminal investigations be separated. In some countries,
          the law prohibits use of civil tax information for a separate criminal purpose, such as
          using civil tax information for a corruption investigation. A parallel investigation in this
          circumstance may more readily safeguard inappropriate disclosure of tax information while
          still maintaining co-ordination with the anti-corruption authority.
          160. Parallel investigations can also be used to pursue simultaneous civil and criminal
          investigations, which could not be pursued as a joint operation. Most countries require civil
          and criminal investigations to remain separate, but the authorities may still co-ordinate
          their efforts and share information in a parallel investigation. In doing so, authorities must
          be careful to respect due process, for example, by ensuring any disclosure obligations
          to the suspect are met and that criminal processes are not used as a pretext to obtain
          information for a civil investigation and vice versa. A defendant who co‑operates with a
          civil investigation may need to be advised that their co-operation could potentially be used
          for a criminal investigation.
          161. A parallel investigation may also be preferable for procedural or strategic reasons
          if a jurisdiction has technical legal rules that lead to undesirable consequences from joint
          investigations. These considerations generally relate to procedural issues and need to
          be assessed by each country on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking, maintaining
          distinct investigations has merits where the authorities expect to conduct their own separate
          prosecutions. For example, if the investigations are distinct, the court is less likely to expect
          the authority bringing the prosecution to know all of the materials residing in the other
          authority’s files. In another example, one authority may enjoy procedural advantages not
          available to the other, such as disclosure protections, that they can preserve by maintaining
          a distinct parallel investigation.
          162. Unfortunately, in other circumstances, an authority may choose a parallel investigation
          over a joint one due to a dysfunctional relationship with another authority. One authority
          may wish to limit or control the other’s involvement because of poor relations between
          management, distrust, lack of belief in the other agency’s ability, or concern that another
          authority may take credit for a particular case. It may be necessary for authorities to take
          steps to build trust, develop closer ties, and achieve a better understanding of each other’s
          approaches before progressing from parallel to joint investigations.
          163. Well-co-ordinated parallel investigations can enhance co-operation between tax
          authorities and anti-corruption authorities, but this is unlikely to be to the same extent as
          joint operations. In general, they do not enable authorities to directly draw on the wider
          range of skills and experiences that they could offer each other and may also lead to work
          being duplicated. As the parties to parallel investigations do not work as closely together,
          they tend to be less effective at building strong networks between authorities.

Other structured co-ordination fora
         164. Countries may choose to establish other structured co-ordination fora in order to
         develop particular capabilities (for example crime fighting strategies, threat assessments, or
         detection of crime) or to co-ordinate at a strategic (non-operational) level the fight against
         specific types of crime (such as foreign bribery cases, national security threats or organised
         crime). Unlike taskforces, which were considered in the previous chapter, these fora do not
         have a direct operational role. Instead, they enable a particular issue to be examined jointly
         by several authorities and for those authorities to contribute to shared solutions.
         165. Countries have developed a range of other co-ordination mechanisms and applied
         them to tax and anti-corruption collaboration. The structure of these mechanisms can be
         moulded to the needs and circumstances of each authority. What they have in common
         is that each brings together tax, anti-corruption, and other authorities at regular intervals
         for structured analysis or discussions on issues to advance a shared objective. In practice,
         these fora vary considerably and have been used by both tax authorities and anti-corruption
         authorities:
              •   Develop inter-agency crime fighting strategies. In Finland, the steering group for
                  the prevention of economic crime includes representatives from different authorities,
                  including the prosecution service, the police, the customs administration, and the
                  tax administration, as well as from a number of ministries. The steering group
                  meets on a regular basis and has, among other things, prepared the National
                  Strategy for Tackling the Shadow Economy and Economic Crime for 2016-2020.
              •   Assess threats. In Lithuania, the Financial Crimes Investigations Service and the
                  State Tax Inspectorate have established the Risk Analysis Centre, which includes
                  officials from both authorities, and since 2014, includes the Customs Department
                  under the Ministry of Finance. The Risk Analysis Centre analyses information
                  received from all participating authorities, and makes proposal for competent
                  authorities to carry out operational activities and conduct pre-trial investigations.
                  It analyses and exchanges information between the institutions to identify threats
                  to the country’s financial system and tax collection, and to identify tax evasion,
                  corruption and other criminal conduct.
              •   Proactively detect misconduct. Lithuania’s Risk Analysis Centre also co-ordinates
                  common operations in order to prevent, detect, and investigate tax law violations
                  or crimes. Upon the detection of possible tax evasion or other criminal activity,
                  it informs the relevant law enforcement authority, gives suggestions on priority
                  actions, and conducts further enquiries with respect to the facts it has uncovered.
              •   Co-ordinate bribery cases. In Israel, an inter-ministerial team headed by the
                  Director of the Department of Criminal Affairs in the State Attorney’s Office
                  monitors and co-ordinates the examination of information regarding suspected
                  bribery of foreign public officials. The team meets periodically with representatives
                  from a range of law enforcement and regulatory authorities, including the tax
                  authority. The work of the team does not replace the work of the Israeli Police and
                  other law enforcement authorities in investigating foreign bribery; rather it provides
                  a practical co-ordination and advisory role.
              •   Co-ordinate security related cases. Ghana uses inter-agency co-operation to
                  promote national security. At the national level, it has established a forum that
                  comprises the customs division of Ghana Revenue Authority and the Economic

"89","88 – 8. Other co-ordination mechanisms
                  and Organised Crime Office. This forum is supported by a second-tier meeting
                  comprising those same two authorities, the police, CID and Ministry of Finance.
              •   Distil lessons from past investigations. In Austria, based on an inter-institutional
                  agreement between the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Ministry of
                  the Interior, meetings between the investigators of the Federal Bureau of Anti-
                  Corruption and of the Tax Investigation Department take place approximately
                  twice per year. The main objective of these meetings is the exchange of feedback
                  concerning cases that are being investigated by both authorities. Investigators from
                  the two authorities do not work collaboratively on cases, but share feedback and
                  experiences once a case is completed.
Joint intelligence centres
          166. Joint intelligence centres are a co-ordination mechanism that countries should
          consider adopting to add efficiency and overarching perspective to the collection, analysis,
          and distribution of intelligence. They are a particularly effective tool for identifying
          connections and trends between sets of data held by separate authorities and for developing
          a whole of government approach to combating financial crime. They may also add value in
          circumstances where an individual agency is unable to effectively manage the large volume
          of available intelligence or where multiple agencies have overlapping intelligence functions
          that could be centralised. To run effectively, information sharing rules may need to be
          adjusted to enable the centre to receive and handle intelligence from multiple agencies.
          167. Joint intelligence centres collect, store, and analyse information and co-ordinate
          the sharing of it between agencies. The benefit of such centres lies in their ability to pool
          experts from a wider range of fields than each agency would typically be able to employ
          and provide access to intelligence that would not otherwise have been available to each
          participating agency. By centralising the function of data analysis, joint intelligence centres
          can look across a wider spectrum of financial crime data than individual authorities acting
          on their own, and can more easily identify trends or individual cases where corruption and
          tax crime overlap. A further benefit is that these centres may improve the effectiveness
          of existing gateways for providing information as tax and anti-corruption officials within
          the centres gain experience in the legal and practical aspects of information sharing and
          develop professional contacts for future co-operation.
          168. Joint intelligence centres may be configured in various ways depending on their
          purpose and the information sharing framework in which they operate. In general, the
          key decisions regarding establishing a joint intelligence centre concern its organisation,
          purpose, function and data sources:
              •   Organisation: standalone body vs. unit of an existing agency. A standalone
                  body requires setting up a suitable governance and decision-making framework,
                  for which special laws regarding information sharing may be necessary. It may
                  also require establishing a new legal entity or government agency. Alternatively,
                  it may be established on a more informal basis, for instance an exchange of letters
                  or memorandum of understanding between participating authorities. It can employ
                  staff or work on the basis of secondments from other authorities, or a mix of both.
                  Having a standalone body generally gives the centre greater independence from
                  any one agency and would tend to be more suitable to a centre with a broad, cross-
                  cutting purpose. A unit of an existing agency is generally more straightforward
                  to establish and often enables the host agency to play a strong role in leading the

                  work of the centre. There may be practical reasons for choosing this organisational
                  model, for example, if the centre is primarily focused on combating tax crime it
                  may be advisable to establish it in the tax authority.
              •   Purpose: narrow vs. broad. The overarching purpose of any joint intelligence
                  centre is to collect, analyse, and share information. However, beyond this common
                  feature, joint intelligence centres can serve myriad different purposes. A narrow
                  purpose could include detecting a particular crime type, such as corruption in the
                  public sector or VAT fraud. A broader purpose may be to understand and identify
                  financial crime trends, including tax crime and corruption, or to develop policy and
                  operational responses to emerging corruption or tax crime risks.
              •   Function: operational vs. strategic. An operational function means the centre
                  is focused on specific cases or a group of cases, for example proposing specific
                  large-scale targets for investigation by participating anti-corruption authorities. The
                  operational function may extend beyond managing intelligence to co-ordinating
                  investigative action by multiple authorities, reviewing cases or even conducting
                  investigations. A strategic function focuses on conducting threat or risk assessments,
                  which could include examining whether economic criminals are changing the way
                  they operate. These assessments can inform the overarching strategy against
                  financial crime and help to co-ordinate the priorities and objectives of tax and anti-
                  corruption agencies. They may also inform the development of new tactics and
                  techniques for combating financial crime. It is common for intelligence centres to
                  perform both operational and strategic functions.
              •   Data source: Information gathering powers vs. relying on information gathering
                  powers of others. A joint intelligence centre established as a standalone body
                  may have its own information gathering powers. Where appropriate, these
                  powers may even exceed those of an individual participating authority so that the
                  centre can effectively work with information relevant to multiple authorities. In
                  addition, as they deal with intelligence rather than evidence, it may be appropriate
                  to grant joint intelligence centres coercive or other special powers not available
                  to law enforcement authorities. Otherwise, joint intelligence centres rely on the
                  information gathered by participating agencies or open sources. Through public/
                  private partnerships, industry can also provide data.
         169. Several countries currently utilise joint intelligence centres in which both tax
         authorities and anti-corruption authorities participate. A sample of these is presented in
         Box 8.1.

                            Profile of the Grey Economy Information Unit (GEIU) – Finland
             Organisation                       The Grey Economy Information Unit (Harmaan talouden selvitysyksikkö) is a
                                                specialist unit within the Finnish tax administration.
             Purpose                            Established in 2011 to work closely with other government agencies. Agencies
                                                with the appropriate legal permissions can become a client of the GEIU.
                                                Currently there are 22 authorities with permission to request compliance reports
                                                from the GEIU. GEIU was set up to offer a permanent and efficient solution to
                                                the challenges of gathering and sharing information.
             Operational or strategic function? Both. GEIU gathers, produces, shares, and publishes information as “grey
                                                economy reports” in order to support strategic decision making against the
                                                shadow economy.
                                                GEIU also produces “compliance reports” on organisations and individuals for
                                                other authorities to support their tasks at the operational level. Compliance
                                                reports include information how a person has complied with legal obligations
                                                concerning tax and other payments, business activities, financial position and
                                                connections. GEIU provides a large amount (250 000 in 2017) of compliance
                                                reports through automatic interface solutions. This means that most compliance
                                                reports are produced automatically and delivered to the information system of
                                                the requesting authority.
                                                Finland explains that GEIU has helped to address the challenges of sharing
                                                data between agencies and that the Finnish parliament has been responsive
                                                in removing legal barriers to its success. Finland further notes the benefit of
                                                having a centralised unit is that it can improve efficiency, which in turn gives the
                                                authorities requesting the information more time to tackle the grey economy.
             Data sources                       GEIU collects data from the existing databases of other authorities.

             Purpose                            Established as part of an inter-agency strategy to address serious organised
                                                crime, including financial crime.
             Operational or strategic function? Both. The National Intelligence Centre (NIC) conducts intelligence analysis to
                                                inform law enforcement strategy and has an operational function for intelligence
                                                co-ordination.
                                                One of the NIC’s main tasks is to compile a common threat assessment, which
                                                is used as the basis for strategic decision making by the participating agencies.
                                                The NIC identifies and maintains databases of indicators of organised crime,
                                                and of factors that facilitate organised crime, to be used in preventing and
                                                detecting offences. The NIC also co-ordinates flows of information between the
                                                Regional Intelligence Centres (RICs).
                                                The eight RICs are located at the headquarters of the local police authority
                                                and are responsible for conducting intelligence work in their respective region.
                                                The composition of RICs varies, but typically they comprise officers from all
                                                collaborating agencies, as well as from the Immigration Service. Officers
                                                assigned to a RIC generally work together for three days a week, with the
                                                remaining time spent working within their own agency. Each agency must
                                                provide their agents with technology to allow them to access agency information
                                                directly from the RIC’s office.

             Purpose                              Established in order to combat serious and organised crime.
             Operational or strategic function?   Both. The IFC combines forces from the Israeli Police, the Tax Authority and
                                                  the Money Laundering Prohibition Authority. It enables enforcement and
                                                  intelligence entities to work together, exchange information in real time and
                                                  produce high-quality collaborative intelligence materials. Israel reports that,
                                                  as a result, the flow of information between entities has improved, thereby
                                                  enhancing the overall quality of enforcement and warning, subject to the
                                                  restrictions imposed by law. Tax authorities are able to use the information
                                                  gathered at the IFC for their own purposes.

             Operational or strategic function?   Both. Its mission is to strengthen the financial sector by encouraging,
                                                  co‑ordinating and increasing co-operation between the partner organisations
                                                  through the exchange of information and the sharing of information, knowledge
                                                  and skills. FEC shares information and builds a knowledge centre for the benefit
                                                  of all partners, for example regarding money laundering and a range of financial
                                                  frauds.
             Data sources                         Partner organisations. FEC maintains an information group, which is composed
                                                  of staff from each of the FEC partners. They provide general and specific
                                                  data to the FEC Information Platform, mostly on jointly formulated issues. The
                                                  Information Platform “pushes and pulls” information for the FEC partners. The
                                                  exchange of information in the information platform is a continuous process
                                                  controlled by FEC unit employees.
Secondments and co-location of staff
         170. Secondments and the co-location of personnel can improve working arrangements
         between anti-corruption and tax authorities. It is a cost-effective tool for building professional
         networks and developing greater awareness of the work of another authority, and may
         be particularly useful when one authority is conducting a major investigation for which
         additional resources are needed. When setting up these arrangements any information
         sharing restrictions between the participating authorities should be identified and managed
         appropriately.
         171. This strategy enhances other forms of co-operation by improving the ability of the
         seconded individual to identify opportunities for co-operation and to develop a deeper
         understanding of the other authority and personal contacts, which can be used to further
         develop co-operation in future. As a result, the speed and efficiency of information sharing
         is increased and the level of understanding of the work of the other authority enhanced.

"93","92 – 8. Other co-ordination mechanisms
          172. In the tax and anti-corruption context in particular, secondments are a highly effective
          tool for officials to learn about the indicators of tax crime and corruption. They also provide
          a robust basis for countries to develop enhanced forms of co-operation, namely joint
          operations or taskforces. These arrangements can be utilised when a major investigation
          needs additional resources, such as staff to assist in carrying out a raid or analysing
          large volumes of documents. Caution needs to be exercised to ensure that any applicable
          information sharing rules are not violated as a consequence of the co-location, which may
          require temporarily removing the seconded official’s access to information in their home
          agency where necessary.
          173. In practice, based on country survey responses, it appears more common for tax
          officials to be seconded to anti-corruption or prosecution authorities to assist on complex
          cases, rather than the reverse. Seconded tax officials are able to apply their specialist
          knowledge of tax to add significant value to the work performed by corruption investigators.
          However, there would also be benefits for tax authorities in accepting secondments of anti-
          corruption experts, particularly where tax authorities are examining circumstances where
          corruption red flags are present.
                         Box 8.2. Co-location of tax and anti-corruption staff – Finland
                  In Finland, the investigation of the most serious and complex corruption cases, including
             those with an international connection, are generally transferred to the specialised National
             Bureau of Investigation of the Finnish Police. The Asset Recovery Office (ARO) is located
             in the Criminal Investigation Division at the National Bureau of Investigation. The ARO is
             mainly staffed by personnel from the Finnish police, but also includes officials from the tax
             administration.
                  Finland estimates that the most significant benefit from this co-location of staff is that
             criminal investigators are able to obtain the necessary tax information immediately and thus
             can have a comprehensive overview on the financial status of the suspected person (even
             though this can also be achieved with the compliance reports mentioned in the previous section
             of this chapter). From the Tax Administration’s point of view, the enquiries made by criminal
             investigators can prompt the tax administration to scrutinise taxation issues more closely,
             which may lead to a tax audit. Overall, the co-location enables comprehensive overview of the
             target in a way that supports both the civil and criminal investigation aspects of a case.
Reviewing the tax affairs of persons sanctioned for corruption offences
          174. Calling on the tax authority to review the tax affairs of persons sanctioned for
          corruption ensures the financial benefits derived from corruption are stripped from
          offenders and promotes the integrity of the tax system. Where this process is allowed
          (as discussed below, some countries prohibit the tax administration from reassessing tax
          liability after a corruption conviction), it is another cost-effective measure since the person
          has already been found to have committed an offence and the remaining question is whether
          their historical tax assessments are accurate in light of that finding. These countries should
          consider establishing a simple operational mechanism whereby the relevant anti-corruption
          or prosecution authority routinely refers corruption cases that result in conviction to the tax
          authority for assessment.

         175. Information concerning persons that have been sanctioned for corruption offences
         may be used for the purposes of reviewing their tax compliance in a particular country,
         even if this does not lead to a criminal tax investigation. This applies equally to persons
         sanctioned for supply and demand-side bribery (e.g. the individual or company that pays a
         bribe and the public official that receives the bribe payment).
         176. The UNCAC requires that “Each State Party … disallow the tax deductibility
         of expenses that constitute bribes… and where appropriate, other expenses incurred in
         furtherance of corrupt conduct.” Similarly, the OECD 2009 Council Recommendation on
         Tax Measures for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
         Business Transactions, recommends among other things, “that Member countries and other
         Parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention explicitly disallow the tax deductibility of
         bribes to foreign public officials, for all tax purposes in an effective manner”. To support
         the implementation of this Recommendation, the OECD Working Group on Bribery,
         which is made up of States Parties to the Convention, regularly recommends that countries
         implement a system whereby relevant law enforcement authorities can promptly inform the
         tax administration of all foreign bribery related convictions so that it may verify whether
         bribes were illegally deducted. 1 It is similarly important to review the tax affairs of persons
         sanctioned for demand-side bribery (e.g. corrupt public officials), as they may have disguised
         the bribe payments they received as legal income.
         177. While in the majority of countries in this report there are no legal barriers preventing
         officials from examining the tax affairs of persons convicted of corruption, most countries
         appear to lack the operational frameworks to ensure that this occurs in practice. Of
         the 53 countries that responded to this part of the survey, 46 confirmed that their tax
         administration is able to examine the tax affairs of persons convicted of corruption. 2
         However, little information is available on how often this occurs, and in general, a review
         is not mandatory or automatic. 3
                              Figure 8.1. Can your country’s tax administration review
                                  the tax affairs of persons convicted of corruption?
                                                        No
                                                                     Yes
         178. In contrast, in seven countries, the tax administration is not able to examine the tax
         affairs of a person simply because they have been sanctioned for corruption without other
         specific indicators of tax non-compliance. 4

          179. In light of the prohibition on the tax deductibility of bribes in both the OECD Anti-
          Bribery Convention and UNCAC, countries are encouraged to consider whether they
          have appropriate legislation, procedures, and practices in place to review substantiated
          corruption in order to ensure that tax deductions for bribes and other expenditures have

          180. Registers for the income and assets of public officials may assist in the detection
          of tax crime or corruption and may provide other information to support an investigation
          or assessment. If they are administered (or accuracy tested) by the tax or anti-corruption
          authority, they may also prompt information sharing between these authorities when
          indicators of tax crime or corruption are identified in the register’s information.
          181. The majority of countries in this report operate registers for the income and asset
          disclosure (IAD) by certain public officials. 6 Requirements differ significantly from
          country to country in terms of who is required to file income and asset declarations, what
          information filers are required to declare, and how often filers are required to declare. 7
          However, the rules concerning such registers generally require high-level officeholders (such
          as heads of state, ministers, members of parliament, other civil servants) to disclose personal
          and business assets and may also require disclosure of sources of income, interests in profit
          and non-profit corporations/organisations, debts, gifts, payments for travel or other benefits,
          and the income and assets of relatives. It is good practice to require the disclosure of assets
          for which the public official is the beneficial owner, and not merely the legal owner.
                Box 8.3. Examples of IAD systems administered by tax or anti-corruption
                                            authorities – Rwanda and Latvia
                 In Rwanda, the Office of the Ombudsman (responsible for some corruption investigations)
            receives and checks IADs. While no other institution is authorised to access the data directly,
            during criminal proceedings, the prosecutor general (who is also responsible for tax and
            corruption investigations) or the president of a court can request information concerning
            suspects’ assets from the Office of the Ombudsman. This information can only be used for that
            specific proceeding and cannot be disclosed to any other institution.
                 In Latvia, the register of public officials’ declarations is administered by the tax administration
            (State Revenue Service, SRS). Latvia explains that the register is related to the prevention of
            corruption, as information specified in public officials’ declarations is often used in revealing
            corruption-related criminal offences. The anti-corruption authority (Corruption Prevention
            and Combating Bureau (KNAB)) has online access to the SRS Information System of Public
            Officials’ Declarations and, hence, has direct access to the all information specified in public
            officials’ declarations. This includes such information as real properties, vehicles, securities,
            income, positions held, transactions performed, cash savings, debt commitments and relatives.
          182. While the primary goals of IAD registers are to promote integrity in public office,
          avoid conflicts of interest, foster public trust in government, and combat corruption, they
          also play a role in facilitating inter-agency co-operation, by improving the quality of
          information that is available.

         183. In relation to anti-corruption efforts, IAD registers can assist national and international
         financial investigations and prosecutions, international asset recovery efforts, combating
         illicit enrichment, and in identifying politically exposed persons. The World Bank has
         produced a guide, Public Office, Private Interests: Accountability through income and asset
         disclosure, to help policy makers and practitioners engaged in developing and using IAD
         schemes to establish the capacities and institutional links required for better use by anti-
         corruption authorities. Anti-corruption investigators may use income and asset registries as
         a valuable source of information, or even a mechanism to facilitate prosecution of officials
         for a violation of the disclosure requirement or as a result of irregularities in their income and
         asset declarations, when underlying acts of corruption may be difficult to prove.
         184. There are also complementary functions between the IAD system and the tax
         authority in assessing tax revenue. 8 Through close co-operation, effective IAD schemes
         can help to support the tax authority to monitor the wealth of public officials. The tax
         administration and the competent IAD authority can co‑operate in the verification process
         to ensure the accuracy of declarations made by public officials to both the tax authority
         and the competent authority. Inconsistencies in these declarations should raise red flags
         and prompt thorough examination by either or both authorities. Further, the information
         in the IAD registry itself may indicate possible tax evasion or corruption if it suggests
         disconnection between documented income and assets, on the one hand, and actual property
         or assets owned by a public official, on the other.

                                             Concluding remarks
         185. Corruption and tax crime remain key obstacles to sustainable economic, political,
         and social development, particularly in developing and emerging economies. It is well
         established that economic offences such as bribery and corruption and tax evasion reduce
         efficiency and increase inequality and this report confirms that co-operation between tax
         authorities and anti-corruption authorities is critical to overcoming this. While all countries
         surveyed for this report have at least some measures in place to facilitate co-operation
         between authorities responsible for enforcing tax crime and corruption, there is substantial
         room for improvement when it comes to implementing these in practice.
         186. The report highlights that enhancing co-operation requires a multi-faceted approach
         and recommends that countries consider a broad range of co-operation mechanisms. There
         is no single correct approach and countries must develop a co-operation framework that
         works within their domestic context and ensures the confidentiality of sensitive information.
         However, at a minimum, this requires a robust and clearly defined institutional framework,
         legal gateways and operational procedures that permit reporting and information sharing
         between authorities, and comprehensive training delivered on an ongoing basis. The report
         also highlights the benefits of enhanced co-ordination measures such as joint operations and
         taskforces, parallel investigations, and joint intelligence centres.
         187. The report commends the positive measures that countries have adopted to improve
         co-operation and provides real life case examples where co-operation was central to
         successful outcomes. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that in most jurisdictions,
         actual levels of co-operation between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities remain
         low. Even jurisdictions with well-developed co-operation frameworks and successful case
         outcomes report that co-operation is still sporadic.
         188. Countries are strongly encouraged to use this report as a tool to identify shortcomings
         in their co-operation frameworks and to take action to overcome these. This could include
         a range of measures such as the provision of additional training, fine-tuning of operational
         procedures, or legislative review. The World Bank and OECD have long been committed
         to supporting countries in their fight financial crime through standard setting, guidance,
         and capacity building. Both organisations remain committed to this cause and to working
         with countries to overcome the challenges highlighted by this report through bi-lateral and
         multilateral technical assistance and capacity building programmes 1 and future horizontal
         projects. 2
         189. While in most cases the mechanisms for co-operation are already available, the report
         does identify a clear need for governments in both developed and developing countries
         to make these mechanisms accessible and effective in practice. Successful co-operation
         necessitates trust between agencies at all levels and this starts with a sustained commitment
         from political leaders and senior government officials to provide political and cultural
         support for the development and implementation of legal, institutional, and operational
         frameworks for co-operation. Top-level support is the only way to establish a culture

"99","98 – Concluding remarks
         of co-operation both within and between agencies and thus develop an effective whole-
         of-government approach to combatting financial crime. When systematic co-operation
         between tax authorities and anti-corruption authorities is used to its full potential, authorities
         will be in stronger position to fight these serious financial crimes.
         190. The report provides an empirical analysis of existing collaborative arrangements
         across 67 developed and developing countries. It also raises several questions that will need
         to be considered by countries as they move forward in developing processes for improved
         inter-agency co-operation in combating tax crime and corruption. These include:
              •    Whether existing models for co-operation in the fight against tax crime and
                   corruption are sufficient, or if new, more integrated, models need to be developed.
              •    Whether certain arrangements for co-operation are more effective than others, and
                   if this depends on the legal and institutional framework, local culture, political will,
                   or other factors.
              •    How the performance of inter-agency collaboration should be measured and
                   assessed and how countries can be supported in determining the success of their
                   own approaches.
              •    What reasonable safeguards should be in place to ensure that the concentration of
                   intelligence is not abused, data privacy is respected, and taxpayer rights are upheld.
              •    Whether the effectiveness of inter-agency co-operation should be the responsibility
                   of a central body or authority in government or left to individual agencies.
              •    How to more effectively leverage inter-agency co‑operation for prevention purposes.

               THE COUNCIL,
               Having regard to Article 5, b) of the Convention on the Organisation for Economic
          Co-operation and Development of 14 December 1960;
               Having regard to the Recommendation of the Council on the Tax Deductibility of Bribes
          to Foreign Public Officials (hereafter the “1996 Recommendation”), to which the present
          Recommendation succeeds;
               Having regard to the Revised Recommendation of the Council on Bribery in International
          Business Transactions;
               Having regard to the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
          International Business Transactions to which all OECD Members and eight non-members are
          Parties, as at the time of the adoption of this Recommendation (hereafter the “OECD Anti
          Bribery Convention”);
               Having regard to the Commentaries on the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention;
               Having regard to the Recommendation of the Council concerning the Model Tax
          Convention on Income and on Capital (hereafter the “OECD Model Tax Convention”);
               Welcoming the United Nations Convention Against Corruption to which most parties to the

          outside the OECD, and that significant steps have already been taken by governments, the
          private sector and non-governmental agencies to combat the bribery of foreign public officials,
          but that the problem still continues to be widespread and necessitates strengthened measures;
               Considering that explicit legislation disallowing the deductibility of bribes increases the
          overall awareness within the business community of the illegality of bribery of foreign public
          officials and within the tax administration of the need to detect and disallow deductions for
          payments of bribes to foreign public officials; and
               Considering that sharing information by tax authorities with other law enforcement authorities
          can be an important tool for the detection and investigation of transnational bribery offences;

           Box B.1. Recommendation of the Council on Tax Measures for Further Combating
                Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions
                                                          (continued)
                 On the proposal of the Committee on Fiscal Affairs and the Investment Committee;
                 I.     RECOMMENDS that:
                 (i) Member countries and other Parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention explicitly
            disallow the tax deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials, for all tax purposes in an
            effective manner. Such disallowance should be established by law or by any other binding
            means which carry the same effect, such as:
                 •     Prohibiting tax deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials;
                 •     Prohibiting tax deductibility of all bribes or expenditures incurred in furtherance of
                       corrupt conduct in contravention of the criminal law or any other laws of the Party to
                       the Anti-Bribery Convention.
                 Denial of tax deductibility is not contingent on the opening of an investigation by the law
            enforcement authorities or of court proceedings.
                 (ii) Each Member country and other Party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention review,
            on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of its legal, administrative and policy frameworks as
            well as practices for disallowing tax deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials. These
            reviews should assess whether adequate guidance is provided to taxpayers and tax authorities
            as to the types of expenses that are deemed to constitute bribes to foreign public officials, and
            whether such bribes are effectively detected by tax authorities.
                 (iii) Member countries and other Parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention consider
            to include in their bilateral tax treaties, the optional language of paragraph 12.3 of the
            Commentary to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which allows “the sharing of
            tax information by tax authorities with other law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities
            on certain high priority matters (e.g. to combat money laundering, corruption, terrorism
            financing)” and reads as follows:
                 “Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used
            for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws
            of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.”
                 II.	Further RECOMMENDS Member countries and other Parties to the OECD Anti-
            Bribery Convention, in accordance with their legal systems, to establish an effective legal and
            administrative framework and provide guidance to facilitate reporting by tax authorities of
            suspicions of foreign bribery arising out of the performance of their duties, to the appropriate
            domestic law enforcement authorities.
                 III. INVITES non-members that are not yet Parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention
            to apply this Recommendation to the fullest extent possible.
                 IV. INSTRUCTS the Committee on Fiscal Affairs together with the Investment
            Committee to monitor the implementation of the Recommendation and to promote it in the
            context of contacts with non-members and to report to Council as appropriate.

Executive summary
Fraud, error and debt cost the UK economy billions    These trials are now up and running and
of pounds each year – £21 billion is lost to fraud    preliminary results are very positive� For example,
in the public sector, a further £9�6 billion is lost  Trial 1 advanced £160 million of tax debts to the
to errors, while £7–8 billion is lost in uncollected  Exchequer over the six-week period of the trial,
debt�1 These significant sums of money are            the two behavioural letters in Trial 2 brought in
ultimately borne by UK taxpayers, so any measures     over £1 million from doctors in additional yield

Traditional attempts to combat fraud, error and
debt have made a number of assumptions about          Each of these trials underlines the benefit of
human behaviour� They have tended to assume,          the ‘test, learn, adapt’ approach adopted by the
for example, that individuals rationally weigh up     Behavioural Insights Team, which recognises that
the personal costs and benefits of committing         the effectiveness of different interventions and
fraud before acting� While this approach has many     insights depends heavily on the context and setting�
merits, new insights from behavioural science are     So we recommend that anyone applying these
increasingly revealing the limits of several of its   insights: tests them in a new context, learns which
key underlying assumptions� The vast majority of      aspect is working (or not), and then adapts their

                                                      Overall, these trials showed effect sizes of up to
of moral obligation, justice and fairness, which is
                                                      30 percentage points, underlining the key role that
shared by those around them� In other words,
                                                      behavioural insights can play in tackling fraud, error

seven of the most important insights that can be
used by public bodies to reduce fraud, error and
debt (listed in Box 1 on the next page)� Part 2

      Box 1: Lessons from behavioural science – seven steps to reduce fraud, error
      and debt
      The seven insights below are all based on evidence from behavioural science� They show that, by
      going with the grain of how people behave, we can reduce the prevalence of fraud, error and debt�
      Insight 1. Make it easy: Make it as straightforward as possible for people to pay tax or debts,
      for example by pre-populating a form with information already held�
      Insight 2. Highlight key messages: Draw people’s attention to important information
      or actions required of them, for example by highlighting them upfront in a letter�
      Insight 3. Use personal language: Personalise language so that people understand why
      a message or process is relevant to them�
      Insight 4. Prompt honesty at key moments: Ensure that people are prompted to be
      honest at key moments when filling in a form or answering questions�
      Insight 5. Tell people what others are doing: Highlight the positive behaviour of others,
      for instance that ‘9 out of 10 people pay their tax on time’�
      Insight 6. Reward desired behaviour: Actively incentivise or reward behaviour that saves
      time or money�
      Insight 7. Highlight the risk and impact of dishonesty: Emphasise the impact of fraud or
      late payment on public services, as well as the risk of audit and the consequences for those caught�
      Box 2: Test, learn, adapt – eight trials to reduce fraud, error and debt
      Trial 1. Using social norms: investigates whether informing people that the vast majority
      of those in their area have already paid their tax can significantly boost payment rates�
      Trial 2. Highlighting key messages and norms: examines whether we can increase tax
      compliance among doctors by simplifying the principal messages and actions required, as well as
      using social levers and norms�
      Trial 3. Using salient images: investigates whether using images captured by the Driver and
      Vehicle Licensing Agency can help to reduce unnecessary repeat correspondence and encourage
      prompt payment of fines�
      Trial 4. Better presentation of information: explores different ways of presenting
      information to discover which is most effective at encouraging the payment of debts�
      Trial 5. Personalising text messages: tests the impact of sending more personalised text
      messages on people’s propensity to pay court-ordered fines�
      Trial 6. Prompting honesty: examines whether simplifying key messages, emphasising the
      consequences of fraud and getting people to sign forms upfront results in more honest declarations�
      Trial 7. Varying the tone of letters: explores the effectiveness of different types of
      communication in encouraging plumbers to get their tax affairs up to date�
      Trial 8. Using beliefs about tax: tests the effectiveness of different messages – related to the fact
      that most people think that paying tax is the right thing to do – on payment of tax debts by companies�

Introduction
Fraud, error and debt cost the UK economy billions      and cues� For example, the ultimatum game
of pounds each year – £21 billion is lost to fraud      demonstrates that in some contexts people

Part 1 – Lessons from behavioural
science: seven insights to reduce fraud,
error and debt
Part 1 draws from the increasing body of behavioural research which examines how individuals respond to
different situations� We have distilled this rich literature into seven key insights which the evidence suggests
can help to reduce fraud, error and debt�
Many of these insights are relatively intuitive� We instinctively know, for example, that if you make it easier
for someone to fill in an important form or respond to a request, they are more likely to do it�
However, what is less obvious is how we can use these insights to practical ends� It is not obvious, for
example, that getting someone to sign a form or write out an honesty declaration before they enter key
information could be an effective way of encouraging honest behaviour�
We should also recognise that, although some of the lessons may seem intuitive, public (and private) sector
bodies rarely think about their systematic application� We routinely complicate processes unnecessarily, use
unclear terms and phrases, and bury important information in the middle of long letters�
     These seven insights, described in more detail in the sections that follow, are:
     Insight 1. Make it easy: Make it as straightforward as possible for people to pay tax or debts,
     for example by pre-populating a form with information already held�
     Insight 2. Highlight key messages: Draw people’s attention to important information or
     actions required of them, for example by highlighting them upfront in a letter�
     Insight 3. Use personal language: Personalise language so that people understand why a
     message or process is relevant to them�
     Insight 4. Prompt honesty at key moments: Ensure that people are prompted to be honest
     at key moments when filling in a form or answering questions�
     Insight 5. Tell people what others are doing: Highlight the positive behaviour of others, for
     instance that ‘9 out of 10 people pay their tax on time’�
     Insight 6. Reward desired behaviour: Actively incentivise or reward behaviour that saves
     time or money�
     Insight 7. Highlight the risk and impact of dishonesty: Emphasise the impact of fraud or
     late payment on public services, as well as the risk of audit and the consequences for those caught�
     It is important to remember that the effectiveness of the application of these insights will heavily
     depend on the context in which they are applied� Part 2 looks at ways in which we can test these
     approaches in practice, so that we can continually learn from what works in different situations�

       Box 7: Reducing errors by redesigning prescription charts
       The majority of hospitals in the NHS still use paper prescription charts that contain details of
       all the medications patients are to take while in hospital� Analysis shows that many such charts
       are incompletely filled in (e�g� pre-existing allergic reactions are not recorded); are hard to read
       (e�g� confusion between micrograms and milligrams and indecipherable signatures); and are not
       updated (e�g� whether or not a course of antibiotics should continue)� Approximately 7% of all
       medication orders have some form of error in their prescription or administration� Such errors
       can contribute to increased costs and the potential for significant patient harm� The Behavioural
       Insights Team is funding a trial of a new type of hospital prescription chart, which draws attention
       to key information requirements and helps to make it easier for prescribers to fill in information
       accurately� This should help to reduce errors in the process�
       Below is an extract from a standard prescription chart – which is prone to errors, partly because
       the layout and boxes are difficult to understand and allow those prescribing to use handwriting
       rather than block capitals�
            These boxes
            encourage looser
            handwriting,
            which can be hard
            to understand
       The new prescription charts – among other things – encourage prescribers to use block
       capitals through the use of boxes, and to circle the unit of dosage� Both of these measures help
       prescribers completing the form to make the information they enter much clearer�
                                                   Dosages are circled, rather
                                                   than handwritten, to ensure
                                                   that micrograms and
                                                   milligrams are not confused
            Boxes encourage
            clearer handwriting,
            which is easier to
            understand

    Box 8: The personal touch
    An experiment from the US tested the impact of Post-it notes and handwriting on people’s
    likelihood of completing a survey�13 The survey which was accompanied by a handwritten Post-it
    note requesting completion received a 76% completion rate, compared with 48% where the
    handwritten message was on the cover page (which contained instructions about how to
    complete the survey) and 36% for those who received the survey and cover page only� In order
    to test whether it was the Post-it note itself that had the biggest impact, the researchers ran a
    similar experiment, where a Post-it note with a handwritten note attracted a 69% response rate,
    compared with 43% with a blank Post-it note and 34% with no Post-it note� In addition, those who
    responded to the handwritten Post-it note returned the survey more promptly and with more
    detailed answers� When the experimenter added his initials and a ‘thank you’, response rates
    increased even further�14

Part 2 – Test, learn, adapt: eight trials
to reduce fraud, error and debt
The insights set out in Part 1 are based on behavioural effects that have been robustly evaluated
in academic research� This research indicates that even relatively minor changes to processes, forms and
language can have a significant, positive impact on behaviour� Evidence also suggests that the effectiveness
of interventions depends heavily on the context and setting, and that – in some instances – interventions
in one domain might not be as effective when translated into other areas�
In order to explore the effectiveness of the insights set out in Part 1 in different contexts, the Behavioural
Insights Team has adopted a ‘test, learn, adapt’ approach� Central to this is the development of randomised
controlled trials (RCTs), which are considered to be the gold standard of research trials�
This involves dividing the study population into two or more groups and randomly assigning individuals to
each of these groups� By giving the intervention (for example the modified letter, the changed process, the
new text message) to one of these groups while continuing to treat the other group as business per usual,
we can determine the difference in effectiveness of each of the interventions� The key ingredient to this
approach is the randomisation of individuals to groups, which enables us to assume that any difference
in outcomes is attributed to the intervention rather than other factors�
Once the trial has been conducted, results can be used to refine new interventions to improve their
effectiveness, and/or decide whether or not to roll it out more widely� In this way, RCTs can enable us to
test evidence-based behavioural interventions, learn whether they are effective and how to make them
more so, and adapt the intervention and/or our policy to improve outcomes and value for money�
This document launches eight separate RCTs� Each trial tests the effectiveness of one or more interventions
grounded in behavioural science, which research suggests may be effective in reducing fraud, error or debt�
In some cases, we are testing the effectiveness of interventions based on a single behavioural effect; in other
cases, the interventions are designed to maximise impact by harnessing multiple behavioural levers�
Each of the trials has been developed in partnership with another government department or public body
and has benefited from the expertise of the Behavioural Insights Team’s academic panel, some of whom
are also helping to evaluate the results as they come in�

• Fairness: this letter highlights a potential conflict
   between the recipient’s beliefs that businesses
   should pay tax and their company’s tax debt�
While it is too early to state exact results,
preliminary findings suggest that what seems to
be particularly effective is to point out any gap
between a taxpayer’s belief that ‘businesses should
pay their taxes’ and the fact that their own company
currently owes tax� Interestingly, what seems to
be less effective is to refer to a gap between the
beliefs of a company itself and the fact that it owes
tax� This may be because small business owners
find the idea that their business has beliefs to be less
convincing than people in larger companies, which
may have mission statements and corporate social
responsibility plans�

"146","                                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 i.       The purpose of this Board Update is to present progress on the World Bank’s (WB)
engagements on Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM) and Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs).
Following the agenda set by recent global summits such as Financing for Development, the emphasis
on the topics reflects the domestic financing challenges facing client countries to adequately fund
development priorities.1 The WB has also positioned the two topics at the forefront, with both DRM
and IFFs serving as policy commitments in the Governance and Institutions Special Theme of the
IDA18 Replenishment.
ii.       The DRM work program is focused on designing comprehensive packages of support that
broaden and deepen the tax base of client governments.2 The World Bank’s country-level tax
support programs are sequenced to provide technical assistance up-front with the objective of
generating demand to support comprehensive, sequenced reform programs, including through lending
operations. This has translated into FY16 loan commitments of $582 million and an FY17/18 pipeline
of $250 million.3 Internally, these efforts have been bolstered by the creation of the Global Tax Team
(GTT) within the EFI Vice Presidency as a focal point for countries and development partners to
engage on all tax related activities. Tax engagements are now organized around three strategic efforts:
(i) strengthening international collaboration; (ii) producing global public goods; and (iii) delivering
country-level programs.
iii.      The WB’s engagements on IFFs build off the agenda presented in the March 2016 Board
         4
Paper. Since the last Board Paper, the WB has continued to establish analytical and operational
approaches to strategically address IFFs as a core developmental issue for country clients. Mechanisms
are being developed and piloted to proactively consider IFFs within Systematic Country Diagnostics
(SCDs) and Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs). Progress has also been made in the design of
global tools — notably the Rapid Assessment Tool (RAT) — to identify countries where IFFs pose a
substantial risk to development. This has now begun to coalesce into greater integration of
interventions at the country-level and the development of country-specific IFFs strategies such as the
emerging program in Sierra Leone (see Box 10). In addition, work is underway to develop
methodologies to measure the size of IFFs in the South African economy at a macroeconomic level,
building on earlier efforts in Colombia (as referenced in Box 2 of the previous Board Paper). Based on
the experience of completing over sixty National Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing National
Risk Assessments (NRAs), the WB has started to develop an assessment tool for a regional risk
assessment. Also, the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR)— the World Bank’s central engagement
on asset recovery together with UNODC— is organizing the Global Forum on Asset Recovery (GFAR)
in July 2017 hosted by the United States and the United Kingdom, which is one of the outcomes of the
1 These challenges are characterized by the difficulties of many government to raise public revenues of above the critical line of
15 percent of GDP and estimated of developing countries losing almost US$ one trillion per year to IFFs.
2 DRM by definition includes the mobilization of both tax and non-tax revenues (extractives royalties, transfers from SOEs, etc.).
While WB support span these sources, this Board Update is on tax-focused support.

to carry out such partnerships and cooperation on asset recovery cases. See Annex 2 for more details
on work ongoing in FY17.
 iv.    Moving forward, it is important for the WB to coordinate efforts across DRM and IFFs
to effectively tackle key financing challenges for clients. DRM and IFFs both have the ability to
constrain the public resources available for public investment and service delivery, resulting in the
need to: (i) identify internal synergies on areas of overlap (particularly tax evasion); and (ii) recognize
the practical boundaries between the topics. Considered together, a comprehensive WB response to the
challenges of financing for development can be developed in order to meet the Twin Goals.

1.       Improving Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM) and reducing Illicit Financial Flows
(IFF) are essential elements of the emerging development paradigm defined by the Financing for
Development Communique and the Sustainable Development Goals. Both issues are central to
enabling countries, communities, and individuals to benefit from economic activity. They involve
institutions such as tax authorities, financial intelligence units, banks, large international firms, and
law enforcement agencies that shape the way governments, individuals, and private firms interact.
2.      Despite their confluence in current development discourse, it is essential to recognize the
boundaries between the two issues. The decision to present a joint update has been driven by the
extent to which they are interlinked at critical junctures. The Board Paper on ‘The World Bank Group’s
Response to Illicit Financial Flows: A Stocktaking’ (March 22, 2016) established a clear WB working
definition on IFFs along the lines of the connection with illegality (avoidance vs. evasion) and
jurisdiction (domestic vs. cross-border)—but the practicalities of measuring and distinguishing lines
of work along these lines remains difficult (see Figure 1, below). For example, while it is understood
that tax avoidance is the expertise of the Global Tax Team, the distinction between avoidance and
evasion is tenuous, and sometimes can only be determined after the fact based upon a legal ruling.

Note: The graph shows the definitional scope of DRM and IFF issues by type of underlying transaction. For example, DRM efforts
aim to address tax avoidance, evasion and tax crime, whether they involve domestic or cross-border transactions. IFF addresses
cross-border transactions of an illicit nature (i.e., evasion and crime), as well as illicit activities that are themselves domestic in
nature but involve cross-border financial flows. The size of the areas does not represent their relative importance in developing
countries, and examples are illustrative.
                                                                     1
"
"149","3.        Moving forward, a focus of the WB is to effectively coordinate support in areas of overlap
between the themes. There are distinct areas of direct overlap between the IFFs and DRM agendas
(particularly within international tax) along technical dimensions (e.g., beneficial ownership of firms
and trusts), within specific institutions (e.g., ports and custom authorities), and at the policy level (e.g.,
the granting of tax holidays or the collection of revenues from natural resource extraction). To be fully
effective, responses must draw from both the DRM and IFF lines of work to concurrently address both:
(i) the tax policy and administration aspects enabling IFFs; and (ii) underlying activities and recovery
efforts to further prevent IFFs.
4.        This Board Update provides an overview of progress made in the DRM and IFFs agendas
and outlines the ongoing work plan. Section Two outlines achievements and planned deliverables
across the three DRM strategic efforts of: (i) international collaboration; (ii) global public goods; and
(iii) country-level activities. Section Three documents IFFs progress since the Board Paper and the
agreed work plan across its five strategic efforts. Finally, the Board Update concludes with
identification of linkages and milestones for moving forward.
                               DOMESTIC RESOURCE MOBILIZATION
Context
5.        Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM) has moved to the forefront of the post-2015
development agenda. The international community has recognized the pressing need for developing
countries to expand fiscal space as part of the “billions to trillions” effort to mobilize resources to meet
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).5 Broadening and deepening the tax base can help
countries avoid dependence on official development assistance and foreign borrowing, while also
serving as a catalyst for broader improvements in government accountability, responsiveness, and
institutional capacity. In parallel, topics of equitable taxation have gained prominence in contemporary
public debate—stemming from events including the leak of documents from the Panamanian law firm
Mossack Fonseca to aggressive international tax planning by multinational corporations.
6.         Increasing tax revenues in developing countries – generally, by broadening the domestic
tax base, improving tax compliance, and curbing tax evasion is critical to ending extreme poverty
and ensuring shared prosperity. There is increasing evidence that countries with tax revenues below
15 percent of GDP have difficultly funding basic state functions. 6 Tax revenues in over one-third of
IDA countries (36 percent) and 70 percent of fragile and conflict-affected countries are below that
threshold, and tax revenues are lowest in countries where most of the very poor live. In addition to

"150","raising more revenue, there is also a need to focus on the quality, fairness, and equity of domestic tax
collection. Revenues raised should end up benefitting the poor on a net basis, ensuring taxes paid are
channeled into public services and other activities with a larger benefit to the poor.
7.        In the face of the growing momentum, the WB and partner multilateral institutions
launched the Platform for Collaboration on Tax in April 2016 in response to G20 calls for sharing
information and developing tools and guidance on tax reforms.7 This platform builds on the
achievements of the 2015 Addis Tax Initiative (ATI), which sought to mobilize funding and ownership
for tax systems strengthening in developing economies. Within the WB, the Global Tax Team (GTT)
was established as a focal point for joining up these activities within the WB. The ambitious DRM
agenda calls for supporting tax efforts in a broader set of countries, including through operations with
improved project design and implementation.
8.        In IDA countries, WB DRM engagement will be further enhanced by the inclusion of the
Governance and Institutions Special Theme in the recent IDA18 replenishment. The need of
IDA18 to concentrate on supporting client governments to strengthen their revenue base — particularly
in FCV countries — has been an emphasis of both IDA Deputies and borrowing member countries.
This has materialized into a policy commitment to provide support to at least a third of IDA countries
targeted at increasing their Tax/GDP ratio through lending operations, ASA, and technical assistance
in the IDA18 period from FY18 – FY21. This commitment to the delivery of coordinated DRM support
is monitored internally by senior management on a quarterly basis and is reported externally on an
annual basis through the Corporate Scorecard.
Conceptual Frame
9.        Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM) typically refers to the generation of government
revenue from domestic sources towards the objective of sustainable development finance. 8 While
the definition can include revenue from either tax or non-tax channels (i.e., extractive royalties,
licenses, transfers from state-owned enterprises or levies), this Board Update is focused on the WB’s
support to revenue collection through taxation. WB client countries, who are most in need of revenues
to ensure the provision of basic services and to reduce poverty, often face steep challenges collecting
taxes. The WB is committed to supporting clients to strengthen their capacity to develop and implement
good tax policy—while also amplifying clients’ voices in increasingly important global tax
discussions.
7 The WB, with the IMF and OECD, joined the Addis Tax Initiative (ATI) at its launch in Addis Ababa, seeking to contribute
through direct support for capacity building by developing knowledge and tools, supporting greater involvement of partner
countries in the global tax debate, and establishing effective arrangements for international organizations.

"151","10.      WB tax engagements aim to support countries to strengthen tax systems by facilitating
the design and implementation of evidence-based tax capacity development and policy reforms.
Real progress has been made on increasing tax revenues—but in many developing countries these
remain below the 15% Tax/GDP threshold. There is no prescribed set of reforms or targets appropriate
to all countries: their potential, in terms of resource endowments and geographic location differ, as do
governments’ goals and capacity. However, the WB has identified three primary DRM goals focused
on taxation (Box 1).
                                       Box 1: WB Three Tax-Focused DRM Goals
              Establish mutually recognized roles of International Organizations (IOs) for more
              effective delivery for clients (paras. 13-16).
              Strengthen the legitimacy of the international tax system (paras. 17-22).
              Achieve a 15% of GDP minimum tax revenue in all countries (paras. 23- 30).
11.      Different strands of work come together to support comprehensive reform strategies at
the country-level. The first strategic effort of International Collaboration and Coordination focuses
on enhanced cooperation by the major International Organizations (IOs) to systematically identify
areas of comparative advantage and pre-empt risks of duplication or mis-sequencing of support. Strong
international engagement underpins the second strategic effort of Global Public Goods that provides
all parties the rigorous tools, diagnostics, and data to consistently identify the underlying weaknesses
of country tax systems and the appropriate entry-points for reform. The third strategic effort of
Country-Level Activities levers the prior two in order to develop the ultimate of coherent, multi-faceted
country-level programs of support. An overview of DRM activities is provided in Annex 1.
12.      Comprehensive country-level programs of support often combine a range of tools over a
span of time. For example, in Vietnam (Box 2), targeted technical assistance was provided upfront
with a view to paving the way for deeper policy reforms. Building up from tools such as the Tax
Administration Diagnostic Tool (TADAT) assessment, targeted areas of need can be identified for
trust-funded TA programs in sectors such as business tax simplification and international tax. Once
clients see results from initial support, this often translates into demand for broader system-wide
administration reforms. Overall results in tax administration improvements can be assessed through
repeat TADATs.

"152","                                      Box 2: Vietnam DRM Program Activities
            Building on a long partnership on DRM issues with the Government of Vietnam, the WB
            has a comprehensive work program, aimed at supporting the country on its transition toward
            a new phase of economic development.
            Building on lessons of previous operational support, the WB work program supports the
            Government of Vietnam in carrying out its 2015-2020 tax reform strategy. As a result of a
            collaborative effort between the GGP and MFM Global Practices, a package of instruments
            is being used in the following areas:
                National and Sub-national development policy lending (DPL): The tax policy and
                actions proposed in this DPL reinforce the objective of revenue generation and
                investment climate improvement.
                Tax Policy and Administration reforms: Drawing on the TADAT assessment led by a
                WB team, a technical assistance project is being prepared to support the Government on
                the design, implementation and evaluation of tax policy reform options, both for broad-
                based taxes and emerging sources of revenue such as environmental and property taxes.
                International tax: As part of the WB’s broader program to support client administrations
                in fighting base erosion and profit shifting risks, the WB supported development of a new
                transfer pricing (TP) decree to help Vietnam implement elements of the G20/OECD BEPS
                project and to join the OECD Inclusive Framework.
                Business tax simplification: This Technical Assistance project supports the client to
                simplify tax regulations and lower the compliance burden for SME taxpayers. Reforms
                introduced include the adoption of VAT threshold, less frequent filing, other filing
                simplification measures on tax and accounting, and the adoption of risk-based audit.
Strategic Efforts
I.       International Collaboration and Coordination
13.      The increased global emphasis on DRM requires unprecedented levels of coordination
and cooperation by International Organizations (IOs) to strengthen client tax systems. The main
IOs (WB, IMF, OECD, UN) already provide extensive support to countries’ tax efforts in capacity
building, policy reform, standard setting, and policy dialogue. Historical coordination around this
support has been traditionally ad hoc, however, loosely organized around the perceived comparative
advantages and mandates of the respective organizations. The increased scale and ambition of global
DRM commitments, therefore, requires sound and comprehensive reform strategies at the international
level to pre-empt risks of: (i) unwarranted duplication; (ii) gaps and misalignment of support; and (iii)
inconsistent or inadequately sequenced reforms driven by the interests and expertise of providers.
14.      The World Bank and partner IOs took a major step in responding to this challenge
through the launch of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax at the 2016 Spring Meetings. The
                                                            5
"
"153","Platform serves as a central vehicle for the enhanced cooperation by the four IOs (WB, IMF, OECD,
UN). It has now formalized regular discussions between the organizations and will strengthen capacity-
building support, deliver joint outputs, and share information on operational and knowledge activities.
In July 2016, the Platform delivered a joint report on Enhancing the Effectiveness of External Support
in Building Tax Capacity to the G20 and will produce eight toolkits and reports mainly focused on
translating the complexities of international tax issues into user friendly guidance for low capacity
countries. The first toolkit on Tax Incentives for Investment was delivered in November 2015. The
second toolkit on Tools on Lack of Comparables for Transfer Pricing Purposes was circulated for
comments in January 2017, while the next on Indirect Transfers of Assets will be circulated by the end
of FY17. Other bi-lateral initiatives have also deepened coherent action including the WB and IMF
Joint Initiative to Support Developing Countries in Strengthening Tax Systems.9
15.        A primary objective of this coordination is to strengthen the participation and voice of
developing countries in rapidly evolving global discussions—particularly on international tax.
Recent years have seen significant and rapid changes in the international tax landscape, with
developing countries estimated to suffer the largest revenue loss from cross-border corporate tax
avoidance, but also with the most to gain through new approaches to access to information on offshore
accounts. Bringing the voice and interests of developing countries, particularly those too small to play
a role at the G20 level, more fully into the debate on international tax policy issues is a key priority for
the WB and the other Platform partners. The WB recognizes that membership in global forums is only
the first step, however, and is committed to ensuring relevant actors make institutional structures work
in favor of countries with varying capacities, including the tailoring of rules and standards to their
circumstances.
16.        The WB will deliver the following under the first DRM strategic effort of International
Collaboration & Coordination:

9 In July 2015, the WB and IMF launched the Joint Initiative ahead of the Financing for Development Conference in Addis
Ababa. Responding to country demands, the Initiative has two pillars: (i) Deepening the dialogue with developing countries on
international tax issues; and (ii) developing improved diagnostic tools to help member countries evaluate and strengthen their tax
policies.
                                                                  6

"154","II.     Global Public Goods: Diagnostics, Data, and Evidence
17.     The second strategic effort is the development of evidence-based diagnostics and tools
that serve as the reliable anchor for a country-level reform plan. Consistent and trustworthy
diagnostic tools are essential for appropriately identifying the weaknesses in a tax system and
identifying the bottlenecks to inform the sequencing of reforms. It is essential for the international
community to co-produce these tools so that stakeholders can use (and reference) the “same
thermometer”. Therefore, whether the WB, IMF, or a country client is applying a tool, it will allow for
coordinated efforts to diagnose the same underlying condition. This shared understanding among
stakeholders facilitates the development of reform strategies that integrate their respective
contributions. Once a reform is undertaken, the rigorous utilization of data and research can provide a
real-time measure of progress—informing both in-country adaptive learning and contributing to the
global knowledge base of ‘what works’.
18.     The WB, alongside partners in the Platform, has pioneered the development and roll-out
of frontier diagnostic tools to inform the selection and prioritization of reforms. These global public
goods are serving as the foundation of WB country engagements (such as the aforementioned program
in Vietnam) by providing a better understanding of the context and performance gaps of the tax system
before designing a reform package. The two primary tools being utilized are:
        Tax Administration Diagnostic Tool (TADAT): TADAT is a framework designed to
         systematically evaluate the performance of a country’s tax administration. It looks at areas of
         core outcomes, using factors such as transparency, the percentage of taxpayers who pay on
         time, and whether an independent, accessible dispute-resolution system exists. It can help
         countries identify concrete reforms and measure progress. Over 35 assessments have been
         performed, for many of which the WB played a lead role.
        Tax Policy Assessment Framework (TPAF): Announced in Addis Ababa in July 2015, the
         WB and IMF are jointly developing the TPAF which will assess the performance of tax policy
         in developing countries in a systematic and standardized manner. Through application of a
         comprehensive set of performance indicators, TPAF allows for the identification of relative
         strengths and weaknesses in tax policy-related systems, processes, and institutions. Based on
         the assessment, actionable reform programs are designed, building a common understanding
         of a given country’s priorities in the tax policy area. TPAF-identified tax policy bottlenecks,
         priorities, and sequencing can serve as valuable information for all stakeholders, including
         country authorities, international and regional organizations.
19.     The WB is also taking the lead in the design of global tools and implementation plans to
support countries to operationalize international tax related reforms domestically. Tax policy and
administration involving international transactions, aggressive tax planning, and tax avoidance have
                                                     7
"
"155","become central issues both in identifying sources to tax base erosion and as impediments to DRM.
Issues such as transfer pricing, tax rulings, offshore financial centers and information exchange —
historically subjects of limited specialist interest — have gained recognition amongst a broader global
audience that is concerned with equitable fiscal policy and sustainable development. The Tax
Transparency Trust Fund finances two work streams targeted at addressing base erosion and DRM
limitations caused by the current international tax architecture as highlighted in Box 3.
                                       Box 3: Tax Transparency Trust Fund
            Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to corporate tax base erosion because
            corporate tax revenues tend to account for a larger share of their national income. These are
            being tackled through tools focused on:
            Transfer pricing, profit shifting, and addressing the international sources of tax base
            erosion:
             Diagnosing the sources of international tax risks and vulnerabilities (e.g., transfer
               mispricing, abuse of tax treaties, aggressive tax planning structures).
             Formulating a policy response to address international tax issues through the
               implementation of instruments, policies, and procedures (e.g., transfer pricing
               frameworks, interest deduction guidelines, prevention of treaty abuse and consistence with
               domestic legislation,), including country and region-based solutions.
             Implementing the administration of instruments (e.g., introduction of new audit
               techniques, risk assessment tools, new accounting standards common reporting standards,
               country-by-country reporting).
            Improving tax transparency as a means to strengthen tax administrations and to identify
            tax avoidance and tax evasion:
             Supporting countries in meeting global standards for tax transparency and exchange of
               information (e.g., identifying beneficial ownership sources, implementation of exchange

             Supporting countries in building risk assessment systems to identify risky transactions that
               could be vehicles for tax avoidance, tax evasion, and illicit flows.
20.      Tools have also been developed to assist law enforcement agencies in preventing,
detecting, and prosecuting tax crimes. The GGP and INT Practices have worked closely with various
tax administrations to develop a Tax Crime Assessment Toolkit with short-term outputs including: (i)
a Tax Crime Awareness Handbook; (ii) a Threat Assessment Tool; and (iii) a note on the benefits and
legal limits of cooperation between tax authorities and other law enforcement agencies. In October
2016, as part of the data gathering process, the WB convened delegates from the East African
Community (EAC) revenue authorities to discuss tax crime hotspots in the EAC region, emerging
threats, and new solutions available to enforcement authorities.

the global knowledge frontier on ‘what works and why’ in tax reform. The GTT has launched a
program entitled Innovations in Tax Compliance with the objective of influencing the design of the
WB’s tax operations by consolidating evidence and identifying the frontier on how to improve tax
compliance in developing economies. The GGP and DEC have partnered to launch the ieGovern
Initiative to conduct impact evaluations that will provide deeper understanding of issues such as tax
behavior and tax compliance. A sample of current DRM-focused studies include experiments on
property tax compliance in Colombia and the interaction of electronic revenue systems and
supplementary tax morale interventions in Tanzania.

"157","III.     Country-Level Activities and Results
23.      The third strategic effort is dedicated to the delivery of coherent, multi-faceted country-
level programs of support. Historically, the majority of the WB’s interventions and support on
taxation have been sub-components of larger Public Financial Management (PFM) projects or pieces
of trust-funded technical assistance. This has resulted in internal activities that were not necessarily
linked and, at times, disjointed programs that did not feed up into a commonly endorsed and country-
owned revenue strategy. The WB is integrating piecewise reform efforts on DRM into a comprehensive
set of interventions to ensure that all tax-related support ultimately works supporting the client’s tax
reform objectives. For example, in Pakistan (see Box 4) the WB is implementing a comprehensive TA
program on tax policy and tax administration that covers both the federal and provincial levels.
Mobilizing staff from three Global Practices (GGP, MFM, T&C), the program has contributed to
results including a 30% increase in a tax receipts and, in turn, increased government demand for future
project support.
                            Box 4: Pakistan Support for Tax Policy & Administration
            To address a low rate of revenue mobilization (9.5% of GDP in 2012), Pakistan is reforming
            tax policy and administration with World Bank support through the Pakistan Trust Fund for
            Accelerating Growth and Reforms (TAGR). The program is built on lessons learned in the
            previous Tax Administration Reform Project (TARP), which encountered strong internal
            resistance to change with tax authorities, by taking a more holistic approach to tax policy,
            tax administration, and expenditure. The project mobilizes staff from three Global Practices
            (GGP, MFM, T&C) to provide technical assistance to support client-driven reforms that
            help meet policy objectives of increasing fiscal space to fund quality social expenditure and
            improved provision of public services.
            The TAGR has deployed an innovative set of tools covering process mapping and
            reengineering of the tax administration, IT assessments, HR assessment, stakeholder
            analysis, and a monitoring and evaluation framework. Front-loaded technical assistance sets
            the agenda for more systemic policy, institutional, and system reforms.
            Results to date (since January 2015):
             Tax to GDP ratio increased by 2% over three years.
             Taxpayer registration and payment increased nationwide by about 9% and 30%
                 respectively.
             Quick-win policy actions implemented (tax exemptions reduced).
             Institutional reforms introduced at the federal and provincial levels (tax policy units
                 operational).
             IT reforms implemented, but not seen as an end in itself.
             Audit strategy and culture is changing to adopt risk-based systems.
             Audit modern techniques and staff capacity enhanced and meeting targets.

"158","24.       Developing a medium-term revenue strategy (MTRS) can enhance country-level
coordination. The MTRS can help support a well sequenced, coordinated tax reform program around
an explicit multi-year plan with support from different partners (see Box 5). Once a revenue goal is
set, the MTRS sets out reforms in tax policy, administration, and the legal frameworks which need to
be tightly coordinated. This encourages the avoidance of the ad-hoc reforms and dispersed policy aims
that, in the past, have constrained improvement in tax administration.
                                             Box 5: Core Elements of an MTRS
                  A social contract on the level of revenue mobilization effort for the medium-term (5-10
                   years) with due consideration to the poverty and distributional implications of the
                   associated measures.
                  A comprehensive reform plan for the tax system, reflecting country circumstances and
                   the state of institutional capacity:
                        o    A redesign of the policy setting to meet the revenue goal.
                        o    A reform of the revenue agencies to properly administer the policy setting and
                             to achieve a high level of taxpayers’ compliance to meet the revenue goal.
                        o    A strengthening of the legal framework to enable the policy redesign and
                             administration reform, including by balancing revenue agencies’ powers and
                             taxpayers’ rights.
                  A country’s commitment to a steady and sustained implementation, notably by securing
                   political support and resourcing.
                  Secured financing for the capacity development effort (technical assistance and
                   training) to support the country in overcoming domestic constraints to formulate and
                   implement an MTRS effectively.

25.       The WB is also deepening client participation through Regional Consultations to hear
and discuss the views and demands of countries about their priorities for support. The
consultations for East Africa were held in Dar es Salaam in April 2016 and attended by seven
countries10. The consultations for East Asia were held in Seoul in June 2016 and attended by thirteen
countries11. Further consultations will be held in the Balkans and Eastern Europe (Vienna), South Asia
(Colombo) and in Latin America. The priorities expressed are summarized in Figure 4, displaying the
demand for capacity development and organizational strengthening as well as support on various
thematic areas. In addition, events held at the IMF-WB Annual and Spring Meetings (such as the
October 2016 event on Tax Treaties) have been used to bring perspectives of developing countries to
the forefront and showcase results of reforms.
10 The East Africa consultations included: Tanzania (host), Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Burundi, Uganda, and Ethiopia.
11 The East Asia consultations included: South Korea (host), China, Mongolia, Philippines, Indonesia, Timor Leste, PNG,
Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Myanmar.

26.     The WB has organized itself internally through the creation of the Global Tax Team
(GTT) to better respond to comprehensive country demands. Expertise on tax is mostly located in
the Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions (EFI) Vice Presidency and include 30 tax experts and
an additional 80+ staff members who are substantially involved with tax in their work programs. The
GTT creates a focal point for countries and development partners to engage on all tax related activities.
This enables WB teams to apply a more comprehensive approach to tax issues, harness particular sets
of expertise, and provide partner countries with a more integrated approach in the efforts to improve
DRM. These synergies are highlighted by engagements like the ECOWAS Regional Program (Box 6)
where the WB is working with four West African countries simultaneously to tackle international tax
issues and deepen regional integration.

"160","                                        Box 6: ECOWAS Regional Program
           The ECOWAS Regional Program is part of a 4 year WB engagement with ECOWAS and
           aimed at deepening regional integration in West Africa. The project focuses on investment
           policy and international taxation to foster the regional expansion of cross-border
           investments.
           The taxation work stream includes a major transfer pricing component which aims to: (i)
           improve legislation and capacity in the tax administration for transfer pricing enforcement,
           with a view to increasing revenues; and (ii) provide greater certainty to multinational
           enterprises on the compliance requirements and risk associated with transfer pricing.
           The program is currently supporting comprehensive country advisory programs on transfer
           pricing and international tax issues in partnership with:
               Nigeria: The team has been working with the Federal Inland Revenue Authority (FIRS)
                of Nigeria since November 2014, providing assistance with transfer pricing risk
                assessment, a number of transfer pricing policy issues and capacity building. At the
                Regional Meeting in October 2016, FIRS announced that it had closed the first set of
                TP audit cases, leading to adjustments of more than USD 20 million.
               Liberia: The team works closely with Liberia’s Revenue Authority since April 2015, in
                support of the ongoing initiative to build an effective transfer pricing regime in the
                country. The WB has provided input and advice on the drafting of the new guidance
                and a transfer pricing return schedule, developed practice notes to guide taxpayers, and
                set up a transfer pricing unit within the tax administration.
               Senegal: Following a comprehensive review of Senegal’s transfer pricing legal
                framework, the team is currently working with Senegal’s tax administration (DGID) on
                revising the primary law and developing the transfer pricing regulations, transfer
                pricing return schedule and transfer pricing manual for auditors.
27.     The expansion of the tax portfolio is ongoing as increasing country demand (in
combination with commitments to the Addis Tax Initiative) requires an increase in support,
which often comes through tax projects. The active portfolio of lending operations includes 86 active
projects with tax themes or components (32 IBRD and 54 IDA). In addition, 29 Trust Funds (TFs),
with a total of donor pledges valued at US$51.6 million, support DRM in developing countries. In
FY16, 19 lending operations were approved, including 10 DPOs and 9 IPFs, predominantly in Sub-
Saharan Africa and South Asia regions.
28.     Including support for DRM as an IDA18 policy commitment under the Governance and
Institutions Special Theme calls for scaling up ambition in this area. Historically, tax lending
operations have been typically executed in middle-income countries (particularly in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia). As one of the largest sources of assistance for the world’s 77 poorest countries,
DRM’s prominence in IDA18 will focus attention on traditionally under-represented segments
including the Africa Region and in FCS countries. Through IDA18, the World Bank has committed to
supporting ‘at least a third of IDA countries targeted at increasing their Tax/Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) ratio through lending operations, ASA and technical assistance including tax diagnostic

Context
30.      The purpose of this section is to inform the Board on the World Bank’s (WB) progress
on the Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) agenda since the presentation of the IFFs Board Paper in
March 2016. The IFFs Board Paper provided a WB working definition for IFFs (Box 7). It also
reviewed the negative consequences for development associated with IFFs, reviewed international
commitments to reduce IFFs, and provided an inventory of past and on-going WB engagements.
Finally, it defined a set of priorities for the short to medium-term that would make best use of the WB’s
comparative advantages to strengthen the impact of work on addressing the activities that give rise to
IFFs and preventing the flow of illicit financial assets.
                                          Box 7: WB Working Definition of IFFs
             Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) generally refers to cross-border movement of capital
             associated with illegal activity or more explicitly, money that is illegally earned, transferred
             or used that crosses borders. This falls into three main areas:
                  The flow itself constitutes an illegal act (e.g., international tax evasion, violation of
                   capital account restrictions); or
                  The funds are the results of illegal acts (e.g., corruption, smuggling and trafficking in
                   minerals, wildlife, drugs, and people); or
                  The funds are used for illegal purposes (e.g., financing of organized crime).
             The principle adopted by the WB is that cross-border movement of financial assets are
             considered illicit only when they are associated with activities that are deemed to be illegal
             in the local jurisdiction.
             Source: WB IFFs Board Paper (2016)
31.      The priorities identified by the WB for its engagements focus on establishing analytical
and operational approaches to addressing IFFs as a core developmental issue. WB efforts on
responding to IFFs have been organized around three work streams as outlined by the IFF Board Paper:
(i) measuring illicit flows; (ii) assisting client countries in preventing the underlying behaviors that
give rise to illicit funds; and (iii) supporting country and international efforts to stop the flow of illicit
funds and recover stolen assets. These efforts as a whole have been provided by different teams and,
as noted in the Board Paper, the challenge is to find synergies and operationalize collaboration across
efforts that had not been conceived as part of a broader engagement. Work is currently on-going to
draw stronger linkages across the different work streams (including between IFFs and with DRM) and
better leverage partnerships (country, regional, and, international) to extend the range, depth, and
impact of IFFs engagements.

"163","32.        This Board Update focuses on the five strategic efforts proposed in the IFF Board Paper.
These five areas of focus (Figure 5, below) were identified in the Board Paper as the WB’s short to
medium-term priorities in order to generate progress and momentum across the WB’s three work
streams.

33.        Since the presentation of the IFFs Board Paper in March 2016, progress has been
achieved across the five strategic efforts. These achievements are reviewed in following sub-
sections. Additionally, an overview of the activities that will be undertaken over the course of the next
18 to 24 months is provided and complemented by a matrix of activities that includes greater detail on
the specific on-going efforts (Annex 2).
Strategic Efforts
I.         Improve the tools to monitor and measure IFFs
34.        A precondition for reducing the developmental consequences of IFFs is the ability to
determine the extent to which a country is exposed to IFFs and to identify those countries where
IFFs pose the greatest risk to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Measurement issues also
loom large in regard to the SDGs, where countries have committed to demonstrating progress in
reducing the problem. Recent work has raised important questions about the methodology used in
current estimations and the reported country and global value.12 The WB is working closely with the
UN, the OECD, and the IMF, as well as other organizations, to establish the tools required to identify
environments where IFFs pose the greatest threat to development, and to determine the impact of
policies designed to stop the flows.13

"164","35.      The objective of the IFFs Monitoring and Measurement strategic effort during this first
phase is to develop the tools to: (i) establish a constructive understanding of what constitutes IFFs,
especially around tax issues and; (ii) refine the specific methodologies for capturing these at the
regional and domestic level.
36.      Since the Board Paper, the WB’s efforts to achieve these objectives are now progressing
along three related dimensions: (i) creating a methodology to distinguish countries on the basis of
their exposure to IFFs; (ii) conducting a country-specific study that explores how to monitor and
measure specific aspects of IFFs at the domestic level; and (iii) developing a multi-jurisdiction risk
assessment tool building on the successful experience of the Money Laundering and Terrorism
Financing National Risk Assessment tool (NRA). While each of these activities is analytically distinct,
they are linked by a common framework for defining IFFs, and are intended to inform and enrich each
other.
37.      As proposed in the IFFs Board Paper, the Rapid Assessment Tool (RAT) for exposure to
IFFs is being designed to identify countries where IFFs pose a substantial risk to development.
Since the Board Paper, a leading group of scholars and practitioners at the forefront of IFFs, risk
analysis, and assessment approaches has been assembled to develop a preliminary version of the tool
(Box 8). The assessment methodology is utilizing existing data sources and indicators. The conceptual
and technical basis for the tool is currently under development and will be subject to rigorous review
and shared in public forums. The preliminary tool will be validated based on pilot desk studies and by
field studies. Application of the RAT is expected to trigger additional analysis on the developmental
impact of IFFs in those countries in the highest risk category. While a point estimate of a particular
country’s level of IFFs may not be possible, the RAT will allow an assessment of a particular country’s
exposure to IFFs in the context of their development challenges.
                       Box 8: Steps in Constructing the IFFs Rapid Assessment Tool (RAT)
             (1) Establish an operational definition of IFFs – accomplished.
             (2) Finalize a conceptual framework to identify the factors associated with risks of IFFs
                 that enables differentiation among countries – within next 3 months.
             (3) Determine indicators/proxies for the factors associated with IFF risk from existing data
                 sources – by the end of FY17.
             (4) Establish a methodology for undertaking the risk assessment and a mechanism for
                 communicating the outcome of the assessment – by September 2017.
             (5) Validate that the assessment tool can be applied across a number of countries and that
                 the assessment categorization is in accordance with field-based assessments – by
                 December 2017.
             (6) Subject each step of the process to rigorous review, analysis, and revision – by March
                 2018.
                                                          17
"
"165","38.        Strengthening country level analysis represents the core of the WB’s work on assessments
and measurements. Work at this dimension is fundamental to designing country programs to confront
IFFs, and for measuring changes over time. During this fiscal year, the World Bank is continuing to
support National Risk Assessments (NRA) of AML/CTF – a knowledge-based decision making tool
used to assist decision makers with identifying and assessing the actual sources of the money
laundering (ML) risk in a country and developing action plans to mitigate their risks and improve the
effectiveness of the anti-money laundering (AML) environment. Thirty NRAs are in process, and five
will be completed by the end of FY17. It is important to recognize that the NRA tool does not measure
the composition or size of IFFs in itself but provides valuable context information. The resulting risk-
based action plans are designed to improve the effectiveness of the AML system as a whole by ensuring
risk based allocation of human and financial resources, and therefore result in improved investigation
and prosecution of financial crimes such as corruption, tax evasion, and fraud. The WB is also
continuing work with countries on strengthening measurement of specific components of IFFs – such
as work in Madagascar on assessing the value and composition of illicit trade (Box 11) and
contributions to efforts to enhance the measurement and monitoring of illegal logging and fishing.
39.        Since the IFFs Board Paper, the WB has continued to develop methodologies for
estimating different dimensions of IFF. Notably, work has begun for the development of a study that
will aim to measure the size of illicit flows in the South African economy at a macroeconomic level,
building on earlier efforts in Colombia (as referenced in Box 2 of the previous IFFs Board Paper).14 In
partnership with the Ministry of Finance and the Center for Financial Intelligence of South Africa, a
team (which includes the DEC experts that developed the methodology for the Colombia study) is
organizing a multi-agency workshop in South Africa to identify the information available and the main
stakeholders. As a result of the workshop, the team will be able to refine the scope of the project and
determine the extent to which the Colombia models can be replicated.
40.        Building from the experience delivering over sixty National Money Laundering and
Terrorism Financing NRAs, the World Bank has begun the development of an assessment tool
for a regional risk assessment. The aim is to develop a methodology that supports clients in
identifying possibilities to strengthen effective international cooperation between jurisdictions, either
within a region or among jurisdictions that are part of one or more criminal corridors. This
methodology will be used in the delivery of technical assistance. It is expected that a consultation on
the pilot of the methodology will be carried in March 2017 in the East Asia Pacific (EAP) region.

"
"166","41.      The objective of the IFFs Monitoring and Measurement strategic effort during this first
phase will be achieved through the following activities:
          Establish and Field-Test Rapid Assessment Tool
              o Finalize the methodology for undertaking a RAT, with field-test in two countries to
                 demonstrate proof-of-concept.
          Establish Methodology for Core Principles of Measuring IFFs
              o Literature review of methodologies for measuring IFFs.
              o Continue development of country-specific methodologies for measuring specific aspects of
                 IFFs.
          Support National Risk Assessments of AML/CMT Risks
              o Deliver five NRAs.
              o Develop methodology for regional and sub-regional threat assessments (including the
                 consultation on methodology in EAP during March 2017) with test in one sub-region.
II.      Develop greater integration across interventions at the country level
42.      As proposed in the IFFs Board Paper, the WB is now working with countries beginning
to explore the creation of strategies specifically designed to reduce and prevent IFFs. Historically,
many countries have been engaged in efforts to prevent the underlying activities that give rise to illicit
flows and/or prevent the movement of illicit funds across borders, but with interventions that have
remained separate and distinct. Going forward, WB support to countries will focus on recognizing and
dealing with illicit flows as well as underlying linkages. There has been some traction with this
approach since the last IFFs Board Paper. For example, in Panama a strong dialogue led to a reform
program to address interconnected issues of international tax and AML/CFT which was supported as
a pillar in a Development Policy Financing (DPF) loan (Box 9). The accelerated and effective reform
program supported by this lending operation—particularly in the context of the elevation of IFFs issues
in the wake of the leak of the documents of the Mossack-Fonseca legal firm—highlights the benefits
of collaborating across GPs on historically isolated topics.
                                                      19

"167","                                   Box 9: Panama Development Policy Financing
            In June 2016, the $300 million Second Programmatic Shared Prosperity Development
            Policy Financing (DPF) for Panama was approved by the Board. This second DPF in a
            series of three was enhanced in scope to support reforms in the areas of international tax and
            financial integrity.
            While the topics of international tax and AML/CFT have been historical areas of focus in
            Panama’s broader shared prosperity agenda, the April 2016 events around the leak of
            documents from the Mossack-Fonseca legal firm further highlighted the need to bring the
            framework for international tax transparency closer to international standards and to ensure
            the effective implementation of the recently-adopted AML/CFT legal regime.
            Specifically, a prior action was introduced focused on the Government’s commitment to
            adhering to ‘Common Reporting Standards for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account
            Information in Tax Matters’ with triggers around:
                 (1) The Government enactment of legislation in line with its commitment to adhere to
                      the Common Reporting Standards for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account
                      Information in Tax Matters.
                 (2) The Superintendence of Banks completion of a semi-annual report on the
                      implementation of the new supervision procedures on bearer shares and beneficial
                      owners (beyond the custodian) in alignment with the amended anti-money
                      laundering legislation.
43.     Initial work has started to identify the entry points necessary to build country-level
demand for the development of IFFs strategies. Details on ongoing WB engagements in Sierra
Leone and Madagascar are provided in boxes 10 and 11. These efforts are meant to generate demand
by enabling countries to gain a general understanding of the dimensions and dynamics of the IFFs
challenge. These efforts also build upon the foundation of the increasing collaboration that has been
forged at the technical level in countries and at the World Bank on traditionally DRM-focused issues
such as preventing tax evasion in extractive industries, strengthening the linkages between tax and law
enforcement officials, and the integration of data on tax payments and financial disclosures. Where
there is strong country ownership, developing a country level approach to IFFs can be effectuated
through establishing greater coordination among existing activities or may take the form of an IFF
country strategy involving a set of sequenced and prioritized activities that are specifically designed to
prevent and stop IFFs.
                                                          20

"168","                                 Box 10: Strategic Engagement on IFFs in Sierra Leone
                A multi-disciplinary team is collaborating this fiscal year in Sierra Leone to analyze the
                scale and scope of IFFs in the country and works toward a strategy designed to reduce
                their negative developmental impact. This efforts, meant to help with dialogue to build
                demand for broader IFFs work in country, will build on existing interventions relating to
                tax policy and administration, corruption and natural resource management to determine
                potential ways to improve impact and effectiveness through greater integration and
                coordination.
                The results of the analysis and planning will be an input into the policy dialogue in the
                country and learning from the process will be captured through knowledge management.
                Similar engagements are under discussion in a number of other countries who have
                started to implement their Action Plans developed as a result of their National AML/CFT
                Risk Assessment exercise and/or countries that are in the process of developing and
                implementing national anti-corruption programs.
44.       As dialogue on IFFs becomes more mainstreamed with clients, demand for country-level
support is expected to increase. Requests for support specifically on IFFs are expected to rise in the
near term based on some preliminary requests for information, spurred on by public demand, and a
continued high-level focus. WB leadership has also moved to elevate work on addressing IFFs into its
corporate commitments. Of particular note, IFFs were highlighted as a core development issues
throughout the IDA18 replenishment process, resulting in a dedicated policy commitment for
‘performing IFFs assessments’ in ten IDA countries from FY18 - FY20.15
15 One of the twelve Governance & Institutions policy commitments for the IDA18 period (FY18 – FY20) is to ‘Perform IFFs
assessments in at least 10 IDA countries to support the identification and monitoring of IFFs’.
                                                                 21

"169","                              Box 11: Fighting customs fraud and IFFs in Madagascar
            The WB is providing a comprehensive set of technical support to the Government of
            Madagascar to combat IFFs through: a review of the level of compliance of the Malagasy Anti
            Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime towards
            international standards using the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) methodology; and
            technical and analytical support to reduce customs fraud in the country, estimated to be at
            least 30% of collected revenues.
            Based on this, on-going support to the government includes a technical compliance review of
            the Malagasy AML/CFT legal and operational framework against FATF recommendations
            (to be completed by June 2017). The assessment report will consist of a comprehensive
            analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the Malagasy AML/CFT regime, as well as policy
            and operational recommendations with concrete priorities to help the authorities combat illicit
            financial flows related activities. Work will also include follow up support on the
            recommendations of the AML/CFT report.
            Furthermore, through an ongoing project on Public Sector Modernization, the World Bank
            has helped design individual performance contracts in the main port of the country
            (Toamasina) in order to better target and reduce fraud. In January 2017, four months after the
            introduction of performance contracts, registered fraud cases have increased threefold and
            collected revenues have increased by 15% compared to last year all other things being equal.
45.      As committed in the Board Paper, the WB has begun to proactively consider IFFs within
the context of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework
(CPF). Using an analysis of SCDs and CPFs, the WB is developing guidance on how teams might
consider IFFs as a development issue, which will be complemented by BBLs and other learning events
to enable WB staff and teams to gain a better understanding of IFFs as a developmental issue.
46.      The objective of the Country-Level Integration strategic effort over the next 18 to 24
months is to institutionally establish: (i) the core components of a country-level IFFs strategy; and
(ii) an integrated method of treating IFFs in the SCD process. This will be achieved through the
following activities:
          Establish guidance for treatment of IFFs in SCDs
             o Guidance for treatment of IFFs in SCDs.
          Work with country teams on developing and implementing IFFs Strategies
             o Creation of IFF country strategy and implementation support plan.
          Increase the awareness of WB staff on the WB’s approach on IFFs
             o Workshops/seminars for WB staff on IFF approaches.

"170","III.      Explore lessons from StAR and their relevance for recovering IFFs
47.       Asset recovery is high on the global agenda and a core component of many IFFs
strategies, included both in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Financing for
Development framework. The close link between IFFs and asset recovery is spelled out in Target 16.4
of SDG 16 which seeks to “significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery
and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime” by 2030. The WB statement at
the high-profile London Anti-Corruption Summit in May 2016 reinforced this focus and highlighted
the WB’s commitment to enhance work on both preventing IFFs and supporting the return of stolen
assets associated with corruption.
48.       The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) is the World Bank’s central engagement on
the topic— a partnership that was established in 2007 between the World Bank Group and the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), supporting international efforts to end safe havens for
corrupt funds. Related to IFFs, StAR helps countries build capacity to trace stolen assets through the
financial system and request mutual legal assistance from financial centers to freeze, confiscate and
return the stolen assets. This initiative also supports countries with actual cases in broad terms (but not
getting directly involved in the cases) and plays the role of facilitator between jurisdictions involved
in the asset recovery efforts. Moreover, StAR provides practical advice while training practitioners
how to use “follow the money” tools, conduct investigations and request international cooperation.
49.       StAR has supported over 30 countries in their stolen asset recovery efforts. Asset recovery
can be a protracted process, further complicated when money is laundered through multiple
jurisdictions using shell corporations that shield beneficial ownership from law enforcement. Lack of
political will, lack of transparency, and the inability for domestic and foreign counterparts to cooperate
effectively are the main obstacles to asset recovery.
50.       In identifying the main obstacles in asset recovery, StAR also learned how to overcome
some of these challenges. Pertaining to the activities under this strategic effort, StAR’s experience
with corruption proceeds may also provide critical insights in the recovery of assets associated with
other aspects of IFFs, including tax evasion and trade fraud. Therefore, the prioritized activities aim to
generate and disseminate knowledge, and exchange good practices and lessons learned with other
fields.
51.       The following two activities will be carried out in the next 18 to 24 months. The first
activity, following the Board Paper commitment, is expected to take place this fiscal year in May 2017.
It will, in turn, serve as a key input for the development of the second activity and any other follow up
work in this field.
             i.    Organization of a technical workshop involving asset recovery experts from the
                   tax and corruption fields, with the objective of providing a space for knowledge
                   exchange and lessons learned. The May 2017 workshop will bring together experts and
                                                      23
"
"171","                practitioners from both developed and developing countries in order to foster a wide-
                ranging discussion with diverse viewpoints resulting in a comprehensive and robust
                understanding of the issues surrounding taxes and asset recovery. The workshop will
                be attended by experts such as tax administrators, auditors, and investigators as well as
                private tax lawyers and auditing firms. Criminal prosecutors, investigators and judges,
                experts from the banking realm, financial intelligence units, and academia would also
                be in attendance. The main focus of the workshop will be tax evasion and will cover
                topics such as tools for investigations and asset recovery, channels for exchange of
                information, burden of proof, key aspects of successful cases, international
                cooperation, etc. The expected output of this workshop is to inform a discussion and
                future publication on the contribution of tax proceedings, legislation and enforcement
                to the recovery of illicit assets.
          ii.   Study on lessons learned from recovery of proceeds of corruption and potential
                applications to the recovery of assets related to tax evasion.
52.      The prioritized activities for this strategic effort are knowledge-focused. Improving
knowledge on recovery of illicit funds can promote more country commitments to asset recovery,
ensure that a wider range of tools are available and used, can guide domestic policy development,
resource allocation, and strategic planning in this area. Furthermore, expanding knowledge on the
synergies between recovery of the proceeds of tax evasion and of corruption can lead to more
collaboration between these fields both at the domestic and international level. In particular, the
development and delivery of the aforementioned technical workshop will be a key activity this year
focusing on knowledge exchange. The insights from this workshop will be collated for input into the
study on lessons learned from the recovery of corrupt proceeds. Any gaps in information will be
identified and addressed accordingly.
53.      The objective of the StAR strategic effort is to deepen the understanding of recovery of
assets beyond the proceeds of corruption, as it relates to IFFs. The effort is also designed to enrich
the on-going work on recovering the proceeds of corruption through exposure to techniques used in
pursuing tax evasion. This will be achieved through the following activities:
          Explore recovery of assets in related IFFs areas
              o Preliminary study on lessons from recovery of proceeds of corruption and potential
                applications to the recovery of assets related to tax evasion.
              o Technical workshop on enhancing the effectiveness of recovery of assets related to tax evasion
                (including topics of channels for exchange of information and burden of proof).
                                                         24

"172","IV.      Build capacity in critical areas for reducing IFFs
54.      The impact of the World Bank’s engagements on IFFs will be primarily determined by
efforts to support capacity development in key institutions. The Board paper provided an extensive
discussion of the range of on-going World Bank efforts that relate to IFFs. The various activities reflect
the span of IFF. One set of activities concentrates on building capacity among tax and law enforcement
officials to identify and sanction tax evasion. Closely related engagements focus on improving
governance in natural resource management, including support for obtaining beneficial ownership
information on companies working in extractive industries, increasing the transparency of revenue
flows around the exploitation of natural resources, as well as the transparency around the content and
signing of licensing agreements. The capacity to address trade fraud is being addressed by extensive
programs with customs authorities and through work on trade policies. Efforts relating to strengthening
financial disclosure systems strengthen systems for preventing corruption and detecting abuse, while
efforts to enhance the functioning of judicial systems serve to reduce the influence of corruption on
the workings of the courts. The engagement is topped off by extensive work on building the capacity
of officials to work with other governments to enable the return of stolen assets. The attached matrix
of activities (see Annex 2) provides additional details on the specific work that is taking place this year
in these areas.
55.      Projects and programs are starting to be developed that bring together IFF related
interventions. Efforts to establish stronger links between tax and legal authorities has already been
discussed in the DRM portion of this Board Update, and serves to link the efforts of the WB’s tax
group with those of INT and Finance and Markets Global Practice. The recently approved Second
Programmatic Shared Prosperity Development Policy Financing for Panama (Box 9) explicitly
supported a combined program of reforms in Panama to enable the country to effectively adherence to
the Common Reporting Standards on tax payments and implement its anti-money laundering regime.
Projects like this point the way towards fully operationalizing IFF in the WB’s portfolio and are
expected to be developed in other jurisdictions.
56.      The WB’s priority for the next 18 to 24 months is to advance capacity development work
on key topics and critical juncture points in operational arrangements. Those topics include:
improving systems for identifying the beneficial owners of firms and other legal entities; establishing
protocols and mechanisms to coordinate information gathering in order to determine IFF risk and
identify specific transgressions; and establishing platforms to enable collaboration between
government and non-governmental organizations on oversight and monitoring of IFF-related activities.
These activities include supporting strengthening of oversight of contract implementation and revenue
collection in the area of natural resource management and increasing information on beneficial
ownership of firms.

"173","V.       Strengthen global coalitions to reduce IFFs
57.      Effectively reducing IFFs requires cooperation across countries, as much as it requires
actions within individual states. International engagement on IFFs is important across a variety of
dimensions – including: (i) integrating IFFs into the broader development agenda; (ii) developing
consensus around how the issue is defined and monitored; (iii) establishing international standards and
commitments; and (iv) helping define the roles and functions of different international actors.
International cooperation is also essential to addressing the specific challenge of preventing borders
from getting in the way of holding individuals and organizations to account for their actions and
returning assets that have been determined to have been stolen. International approaches to IFFs are
particularly challenging in that efforts to prevent the flow of illicit funds across borders can have the
unintended effect of creating barriers for the flow of all funds and may encourage de-risking actions
on the part of financial institutions that carry severe negative developmental consequences.
58.      The WB is actively working across the international IFF agenda. The WB has played a
leading role in developing analytical and measurement frameworks, establishing standards, and
facilitating concrete partnerships in areas ranging from anti-money laundering and stolen asset
recovery, to Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and customs. As the discussion on
DRM highlighted, the WB is deeply committed to working with other international organizations to
ensure that they both collaborate and focus on their areas of comparative advantage. The WB is
following the same principles when it comes to the evolving IFF agenda and is seeking to find ways to
establish sustained platforms for collaboration. As befits the topic, establishing ways to collaborate
with international banks and international organizations involved in monitoring natural resource
management are as important as developing partnerships among the WB, the IMF, the OECD, the
African Development Bank, and the UN. Leveraging the convening power of the WB, and supported
by experience with client countries and knowledge products, this strategic effort aims to continue
influencing the international agenda and shaping international standards, as well as ensuring that the
international standard setters take into account the needs and challenges of developing countries.
59.      The WB’s priorities for the coming 18 to 24 months include the following:
   Support the convening of the Global Forum on Asset Recovery (GFAR). The establishment of
    the Global Forum on Asset Recovery was one of the outcomes of the UK Anti-Corruption Summit.
    GFAR will take place in July 2017, hosted by the United States and the United Kingdom with
    support from StAR (which has extensive experience in supporting regional and global events on
    asset recovery, such as the Arab Forum on Asset Recovery series, the Ukraine Forum on Asset
    Recovery, or the joint INTERPOL/StAR Global Focal Points Network.) Asset recovery requires
    strong political commitment and practitioner interaction. The resolution of complex asset recovery
    cases is greatly assisted by partnership and cooperation between requesting and requested states.
    Therefore, the core objective of GFAR is to provide an effective medium for states to carry out
    such partnerships and cooperation on asset recovery cases. The first gathering of GFAR will focus
                                                     26
"
"174","     on assistance to Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Ukraine, and any other countries that may have asset
     recovery cases warranting support and coordination in the period leading up to GFAR. It will also
     draw lessons learned from a series of Arab Fora that took place until 2015 in a report to be prepared
     in collaboration with the G20, to inform future fora on asset recovery. StAR’s involvement in the
     organization of GFAR is two-fold:
            a) Since GFAR will be held at the premises of the World Bank Group, StAR will provide
                 support and closely coordinate with the US and UK co-hosts. Aside from logistical
                 arrangements, StAR will support the cohosts in developing and finalizing the agenda for
                 the Forum, including substantive sessions and convening of bilateral and multilateral
                 case coordination meetings. StAR will also act as a secretariat for the Forum and support
                 the cohosts in preparing materials and producing outcome documents or statements, as
                 well as sharing and leveraging previous publications by StAR.
            b) As GFAR aims to achieve progress in asset recovery, particularly for the four focus
                 states, StAR will use its resources to plan and organize case coordination meetings for
                 practitioners of the relevant jurisdictions and provide an enabling environment for in-
                 depth discussion and the advancement of specific cases. Capitalizing on its existing
                 country engagements in three of the four focus countries, StAR will gear activities in
                 2017 towards the preparation of asset recovery cases in those countries so as to optimize
                 use of the Forum and subsequent returns.
    Contribute to the dialogue on IFFs, the creation of standards, and international collaboration
     on addressing IFFs through participation in key global forums: Financial Action Task Force
     (FATF); FSRBs (FATF-Style regional bodies); G20; Financial Stability Board (FSB); and regional
     networks on asset recovery (such as ARINSA, CARIN, ARINEA, RRAG, etc.).16 The WB is
     actively engaged in these forums advocating changes to respective standards, developing
     knowledge to influence policies, assessing countries against their international commitments, and
     using the WB’s reach to support international cooperation.
    Promote collaboration and partnerships with key international organizations relating to
     analyzing, measuring, and addressing IFFs. Through joint events, collaborative projects, and
     linked engagements with the UN, OECD, IMF, African Development Bank, etc., establish
     consensus on critical issues, such as creating a practical and meaningful definition of IFFs, methods
     for measuring and assessing IFFs as a developmental challenge, and strategies for addressing IFFs.
    Develop knowledge on de-risking phenomena. AML measures (as recommended by the FATF)
     aim to ensure that all the money flows can be tracked, including those related to profits of crime.
     This provides information to law enforcement allowing it to detect, investigate, and prosecute

(CARIN); Asset Recovery InterAgency Network for Eastern Africa (ARINEA); Red Regional de Recuperación de Activos de

    around the phenomenon of financial institutions terminating or restricting business relationships
    with clients or categories of clients. The WB has recently pioneered research on this subject and
    aims to produce a new knowledge product analyzing this ‘de-risking’ phenomenon based on
    specific case studies.
60.     The objective of the strategic effort to strengthen global coalitions is to build and
strengthen the partnerships that are fundamental to a sustained and successful effort to address
IFFs and the underlying activities. This will be achieved through the following activities:
  Support the convening of a Global Forum on Asset Recovery (GFAR)
     o GFAR is hosted successfully (July 2017).
     o Practitioners are trained in international cooperation on asset recovery.
     o Bilateral / multilateral asset recovery case-related discussions organized.
     o Relevant documents drafted.
     o Technical workshop on enhancing the effectiveness of recovery of assets related to tax evasion
         (including topics of channels for exchange of information and burden of proof).\
  WB participation in key global forums
     o WB participation in FATF, G20 and FSRB meetings.
     o WB co-sponsorship and/or participation in IFF-related events in collaboration with other international
         organizations and agreements among these organizations of regarding collaboration on addressing IFFs
  Conduct research and develop knowledge on de-risking phenomena
     o Preliminary findings on de-risking phenomena study.

"176","                                           CONCLUSION
61.      Ambitious plans on DRM and IFFs have been developed due to the importance of these
issues for the development agenda and the mission of the World Bank. While the two topics are
important for development, it is important to manage expectations of what can be accomplished—
especially for IFFs. Experience with complicated reforms has repeatedly demonstrated the importance
of analysis, experimentation, and capacity building in developing programs that achieve sustained
success. The IFFs agenda has benefited from the global urgency and political will to introduce reforms.
However, it is important to balance this urgency for action with taking the time for the careful work
that is required to adequately identify the priority interventions that are needed and their associated
risks.
62.      Strong linkages between DRM and IFF will continue to be reinforced in the WB’s
approach to these issues. Tax evasion is a major part of the IFF problem that client countries face,
while the illegal nature of IFFs is an important obstacle for tax compliance. WB work builds on these
linkages, and will further strengthen the interconnection between DRM and IFF work. This will be
done through strategic alignment, collaboration in stakeholder engagement in global forums, and close
collaboration in task teams. At the same, differences between the issues needs to be reflected in distinct
client engagement. Whereas the WB has been traditionally engaged with DRM and tax in its lending
and other operational engagements, an operational work stream for IFF has yet has to mature.
63.      Continued effort to strengthen DRM and curb IFFs lies at the core of the development
agenda. Client commitment to reform is essential, and needs to be reinforced by fair international
rules, capacity development support by international organizations and donor countries. This, in turn,
should be complemented by greater transparency and compliance by multinational corporations and
other private actors. The WB will play a critical role as a global convening force and broker on these
issues across stakeholders—with an ultimate focus on strengthening country capacity to collect the
resources necessary to meet to their development objectives.

Corruption in Tax
   Administration
   mahesh c. purohit
        orruption has always been in existence, in one form or
   C    another. As far back as the fourth century BCE, Kautiliya, a
   Sanskirt scholar, wrote, “Just as it is not possible not to taste honey
   (or poison) placed on the surface of the tongue, even so it is not
   possible for one dealing with the money of the king not to taste the
   money in however small a quantity. Just as fish moving inside water
   cannot be known when drinking water, even so officers appointed
   for carrying out works cannot be known when appropriating
   money” (Kangle 1972: 91). Kautiliya points out the ways in which
   employees can be involved in corruption and prescribes the modus
   operandi to be adopted by the king to deal with corruption and
   make appointments.
       Broadly speaking, corruption can be classified into five categories:
   political corruption, administrative corruption, grand corruption,
   petty corruption, and patronage/paternalism and being a “team
   player.” In this chapter the term is defined to include pecuniary or
   nonpecuniary considerations given to government officials for the
   use of public office for private gains.1 Activities that lead to personal
   benefit that do not involve the government or a quid pro quo are
   not examined here.
       The scope of this chapter is confined to corruption in tax
   administration. The chapter is divided into five sections. The first
                                                                         285

section focuses on the main causes of corruption in tax administration. The
second section presents issues related to corruption in tax administration
and analyzes the role of procedures for administering custom duties, excise
duties, and value added tax (VAT). The third section reviews the impact of
corruption on the economy. The fourth section suggests policy measures for
combating corruption in tax administration. It highlights how the design
of the tax structure and procedures of tax administration can reduce the
risk of corruption. The last section summarizes the chapter’s conclusions
and recommendations.
Causes of Corruption in Tax Administration
A variety of factors contribute to corruption in tax administration (box 9.1).
These include the complexity of tax laws and procedures, the monopoly
power and degree of discretion of tax officials, the lack of adequate moni-
toring and supervision, the commitment of political leadership, and the
overall environment in the public sector.
Complexity of Tax Laws
The complexity of tax laws and procedures increases the magnitude of
corruption in the tax system. Tax evasion is more likely to occur in a highly
corrupt environment. Lack of requisite information makes taxpayers unaware
of their rights and more exposed to discretionary treatment and exploitation.
     B O X 9 . 1 Causes of Corruption in Tax Administration
     in Bulgaria
     A survey in Bulgaria reveals that the main drivers of tax corruption are low
     pay, lack of professional ethics, legal loopholes, conflicts of interest, get-rich-
     quick ambitions, and bureaucratic red tape. The less satisfied tax officers are
     with their pay scales or with the fairness of career development and financial
     incentive schemes, the more inclined they are to engage in corrupt behavior.
     If their wages are comparable to the wages for a similar job in the private sec-
     tor, they may not take the risk of engaging in corruption. However, if their
     wages are too low to support themselves and their dependents, the incentives
     for corruption rise. Tax officers’ attitudes to corruption are also conditioned
     by the severity of the punishment for corrupt behavior and the likelihood of
     being punished when detected. Taxpayers do not play a significant role in
     determining corrupt practices.

Monopoly Power and the Discretionary Power of Tax Officials
Tax officers are allotted a particular geographical area of operations. For a
particular taxpayer, the tax officer is the tax department. This monopoly
power gives tax officers the opportunity to create circumstances that entice
taxpayers into corrupt practices.
     A lack of clearly defined roles, functions, and duties of public officials
creates an environment ripe for abusive behavior (Pashev 2005). A high
degree of discretionary power and the lack of adequate monitoring and
reporting mechanisms are vital in providing opportunities for corruption.
The greater the discretion, the greater the opportunity tax officials have to
provide “favorable” interpretations of government rules and regulations to
businesses in exchange for illegal payments.
Lack of Monitoring and Supervision
Because of asymmetrical information, it is difficult to monitor officers and
hold them accountable for their actions. The absence of supervision and
accountability gives workers an opportunity to refrain from performing
public duties. The absence of measures designed to maintain the integrity of
staff—such as the promotion and enforcement of ethical standards, merit-
based recruitment and promotion procedures, and regular staff rotation
schemes to prevent the creation of lucrative networks—increases the likeli-
hood of staff indulging in corrupt practices.
Unwillingness of Taxpayers to Pay Taxes
In some developing countries, such as India, the extreme unwillingness of
taxpayers to comply with the law—and hence their readiness to bribe tax
collectors in order to reduce their tax liability—are important causes of cor-
ruption. Many taxpayers are willing to abet tax collectors if there is clear
gain. This phenomenon is common in many middle-income countries.
Political Leadership
Political leadership sustains and often creates and protects corruption.
Corrupt political leadership makes the spread of corruption at lower levels
relatively easy. A hierarchy of administrative levels is typically associated with
different corrupt transactions. In the case of fiscal incentives, for example,
relatively high-level officials and politicians are more likely to be involved in
corrupt practices. In the case of foreign trade taxes and other routine activities,
"
"187","288    Mahesh C. Purohit
lower-level officials are also likely to be involved, sharing their illegal gains
with those higher up in the chain of authority. It is these routine cases of
lower-level corrupt tax practices that ultimately erode public confidence in
governmental institutions. For this reason, these practices are often seen as
more corrosive than abuse of power at higher levels (Asher n.d.) As the power
of a leader evolves into the political management of a service, the indepen-
dence of officials is rapidly eroded by the interference of political leaders, and
the risk of corruption increases. Political appointments not only reduce work
efficiency, they also facilitate corruption, as they did in Tanzania, where
entrance into the police or the legal profession required joining the party
(Sedigh and Muganda 1999).
Overall Government Environment
The level of corruption in tax administration generally parallels that in the
administrative environment as a whole. Liberal economic systems offer
fewer opportunities for corruption than socialist systems. The greater the
administrative controls over the economy, the greater the problems of mon-
itoring and accountability, because a greater share of economic planning
decisions depend on bureaucrats.2
Administering Tax Policy
The objectives of a tax policy can be achieved only when the policy is prop-
erly administered. Most developing countries face various organizational
and operational constraints to effective tax administration (box 9.2).
In these countries, tax administration plays a crucial role in determining
the real (or effective) tax system: tax administration is tax policy (Casanegra
de Jantscher 1990). Failure to properly administer the tax, therefore, defeats
its purpose and threatens the canon of equity. It allows the government
to collect taxes only from easy-to-tax sectors and people who cannot
avoid paying.
     According to the business process model, the main factor causing
corruption in tax administration is procedures. The greater the procedural
interaction with the taxpayer, the greater the possibility of corruption.
Customs Duty
Corruption in customs administration is a major problem in many devel-
oping countries. Case studies of Mali and Senegal, for example, indicate that

     B O X 9 . 2 The Nature of Tax Fraud in India
     An empirical study based on fieldwork conducted in 1994–95 indicates that
     tax evasion in India occurs partly through collusion between taxpayers and
     tax officers. Of 5,840 offenses detected, 87 percent were procedural. These
     offenses included incomplete or insufficient documentation, inappropriate
     use of credit on capital goods, inadmissible deduction of inputs, taking of
     credit before the commencement of production, use of undeclared inputs,
     faulty interpretation of notification issued by the department, use of unreg-
     istered dealer’s invoices, extension of credit on endorsed invoices, declaration
     of invoices with incorrect address, and submission of invoices that were not
     in the name of the unit.
           “Substantial” violations accounted for 7 percent of total revenue loss.
     These violations included irregular use of deemed credit, extension of credit
     on exempted final products, rejected inputs sent back without reversal of
     credit, extension of credit on basic customs duty, misuse of the facility of “job
     work,” excess credit taken, and the use of the CenVAT (the federal VAT) credit
     by small-scale units that had opted out of the system.
           Fraudulent violations accounted for 6 percent of total revenue lost.
     These violations included extension of credit without producing the required
     documents, extension of credit on invoices without physical movement,
     duplicate extension credit on the same invoice, extension of credit without
     payment of duty, and use of fraudulent documents. These violations show a
     deliberate attempt on the part of the taxpayer to defraud the government.

these countries have faced serious problems of customs fraud in recent years
(Stasavage and Daubree 1998).
     Customs administration in India has been reformed over time. Some
problems remain, however. One relates to the valuation of cargo. Taxpayers
are often harassed on the grounds that the valuation is not correct; on this
pretext, goods are detained. Importers usually compromise on the assess-
ment in order to free the goods from detention. The imported cargo of regular
importers is allowed to pass through a green channel, but the cargo of casual
traders is subjected to a full check.
Domestic Trade Taxes
The system of domestic trade taxes in India is unique. Under India’s consti-
tution, the union government has the authority to impose a broad spectrum
of excise duties on production or manufacture, while the states are assigned
the power to levy sales tax on consumption.
"
"189","290    Mahesh C. Purohit
     As a result of this dichotomy of authority, India has adopted a dual
(federal and state) VAT system. The federal VAT, known as CenVAT, has
effectively replaced the system of union excise duty. CenVAT allows instant
credit for taxes paid on inputs. Empirical studies of its impact show that it
has reduced the transaction cost of business (NIPFP 1989).
     All Indian states except Uttar Pradesh have adopted the VAT, replacing
their age-old sales tax system. Most of the procedures prescribed for sales tax
administration continue under the state VAT. Checkposts at the borders of
each state continue to monitor the flow of goods into the state through the
main arteries of interstate trade. The use of road permits for administering
the tax also continues. Under this system, the importing dealer receives these
permits from the tax department of the importing state and sends them to
his counterpart in another state before importing the goods. The trucks
bringing the specified goods into the state are expected to carry back these
permits for scrutiny and verification at the checkposts. One copy of the road
permit is then sent to the checkpost to the concerned assessing officer. All
imports are accounted for and therefore taxed.
     Although these checkposts play an important role, the system does not
work as effectively and smoothly as it was intended to. The checkposts inter-
fere with the flow of trade and traffic within the state and harass a large
number of dealers, the majority of whom are not liable for tax. The proce-
dures allow for many points of interaction between taxpayers and officials,
some of which could be eliminated.
Impact of Corruption
Corruption drastically reduces tax revenues, forcing governments to find
other avenues for financing government expenditure, including borrowing.
Future fiscal flexibility is reduced, because servicing of debt has to be given
priority over other expenditures. This creates a vicious circle endangering
fiscal sustainability.
     Corruption is particularly alarming because it breeds further corruption—
“corruption may corrupt,” as stated by Andvig and Moene (1990). Collusion
between corrupt taxpayers and corrupt tax officials puts honest taxpayers at
a disadvantage, encouraging them to evade taxes. If they do not, their profit
margins are low, especially for small businesses.3
     The effect on tax officials is also important. Corrupt colleagues and
friends weaken the will of honest officers and reduce the probability of
being detected or losing one’s reputation. As the number of corrupt tax
collectors increases, the guilt feeling of indulging in wrongdoing decreases.
"
"190","                                            Corruption in Tax Administration 291
As Fjeldstad (2005) notes, when networks of corruption exist, firing some
corrupt officials does not improve the situation, as the fired officials become
consultants and add to the network.
     Corruption affects the quality of governance. It forces officials to make
decisions that do not serve the public interest but promote the interests of
corrupt individuals. Administrative efficiency is at a low level because patron-
age and nepotism tend to encourage the recruitment of incompetent people.
     Corruption adversely affects investment and growth (Mauro 1995).
When growth is weak, the returns to entrepreneurship fall relative to those
to rent seeking; the ensuing increase in the pace of rent-seeking activities fur-
ther slows growth. Higher bribes imply declining profitability on productive
investments relative to rent-seeking investments, crowding out productive
investments. Innovators are particularly at the mercy of corrupt public offi-
cials, because new producers need government-supplied goods, such as
permits and licenses, more than established producers (Murphy, Shleifer,
and Vishny 1993).
     Widespread corruption reduces both foreign and domestic investment,
as investors look for locales in which there is less corruption, less red tape,
simpler laws and procedures, and transparent administration, all of which
provide greater opportunities to grow. Corruption leads to economic waste
and inefficiency, because it adversely affects the optimal allocation of funds,
productivity, and consumption. When public resources meant for setting up
productivity-enhancing infrastructure are diverted to politicians’ private
consumption, growth falls.4 Pervasive corruption can also result in refusal
by the donor community to grant aid.5
     The cost of corruption to the society (in terms of both tangible and
intangible costs) is extremely high. Intangible costs include the loss of trust
in democracy, in leaders, in institutions, and in fellow citizens. Tangible costs
include the impact on trade and investments, administrative efficiency, good
governance, and equality of citizens.
     Corruption has the potential to undermine the political stability of a
country, by provoking social unrest and civil war that can threaten macroeco-
nomic stabilization. In Tanzania corruption contributed to political instability
and increased ethnic tension when a leader, for his own political purpose,
claimed that some wealthy businesspeople from Asia, in collaboration with
African leaders, were transferring the country’s wealth abroad and impover-
ishing ordinary Tanzanians (Sedigh and Muganda 1999). He also insisted that
the government was selling the country to Arabs and Zanzibaris. His com-
ments not only intensified racial tensions, which a number of politicians
sought to exploit, they also caused enormous capital flight from Tanzania.

Combating Corruption in Tax Administration
Which policy measures need to be adopted to combat corruption in tax
administration depends on the social environment and the attitude about
corruption held in the society—the factors that account for the degree of
corruption in a country. What is regarded as corrupt practice in one coun-
try may be regarded as part of a routine transaction in another country.
Social norms may be such that allegiance to their ethnic or religious group
supersedes individuals’ responsibility to act as honest bureaucrats.
     Each country has to evolve the measures best suited to its own local
requirements. Some policies that could be adopted by all developing coun-
tries plagued with corruption are described below.
Rationalize the Design of Tax Laws
One of the most important policy prescriptions for curbing corruption is
establishing a rational tax system with simplified tax laws. The number of
tax rates should be as low as possible and the number of tax exemptions as
small as possible (if they cannot be eliminated altogether). In addition, the
tax system should be integrated, with different taxes levied by all tiers of gov-
ernment. For taxes on commodities and services, it is important to avoid
end-use exemptions, a major source of corruption.
     The design of the tax structure should be as broad based as possible.
The goal should be to have as many taxpayers as possible in the tax net,
depending on the administrative capability of the country. If the number
of taxpayers is well below its potential, the burden on each taxpayer will be
too heavy.
     A survey in India revealed that 89 percent of potential income taxpay-
ers did not file (Aggarwal 1991). To expand its tax base, India adopted the
“one-in-six scheme,” under which an individual satisfying one out of six
criteria has to file an individual income tax return, irrespective of his or her
level of income.6 This measure significantly increased the number of indi-
vidual income taxpayers.
Designate Corruption a National Crime
The problem of corruption needs to be addressed at both the national and
international levels. National political leaders must make a commitment to
eradicate this menace. A holistic approach, including prevention and enforce-
ment, will have a much better chance of success than a simple focus on indi-
viduals. The problem of corruption needs to be checked at the international
"
"192","                                            Corruption in Tax Administration 293
level as well. Particularly given the fact that multinational companies bribe
officials of developing countries to procure orders and contracts, a coordi-
nated approach by bilateral donors and international organizations is use-
ful. An important step in this direction would be blacklisting by
multinational organizations of multinational corporations that engage in
corrupt practices to obtain international contracts and encourage corrup-
tion in developing countries.
Reduce Monopoly Power
Since the monopoly power of tax officials encourages them to indulge in
wrongdoing, the first step in combating corruption has to be to curb the
monopoly power of these officials. Two steps have to be taken. First, tax
departments must be reengineered in countries where all activities of
administration and assessment are performed by the same unit. It would be
useful to assign the role of administration and audit to different units, as
many developed countries do.
     Second, tax officials should not be assigned to particular jurisdictions.
Random assignment would not only take away the opportunity of tax officers
to misuse their monopoly powers, it would also free taxpayers from the
clutches of tax officials. For the selection of cases for audit, a separate unit
should look into all available information and apply principles of risk man-
agement. This would eliminate contact between tax officers and taxpayers,
reducing opportunities for corruption.
     Another way to reduce the monopoly power of tax officials is to give
them competing jurisdictions. Since collusion among several officials is
difficult, competition tends to reduce the level of bribes substantially. Com-
petition in the provision of government services must also be accompanied
by more intensive monitoring and auditing to prevent corruption.
Make Civil Servants Accountable and Salaries Competitive
The system of recruitment of officers should be streamlined and a compet-
itive examination system introduced. In addition, training must make tax
officials committed to achieving clearly identified objectives. It should be
made clear to officials that they are fully responsible and accountable for
their assigned duties.
     Civil servants’ salaries should be high enough to allow them to resist the
temptation to use their office for private gain. The incentives for corruption
are considerably greater where salaries do not allow civil servants to live
above the poverty level.7
"
"193","294     Mahesh C. Purohit
      In many African countries, civil servants’ salaries and conditions of
service have continuously deteriorated over the years, in most cases failing
to keep pace with inflation (Kpundeh 1992). In such circumstances, employ-
ees may look for other ways to generate additional income. Departments
such as customs and VAT, which have large numbers of low-paid workers
who are in direct contact with the public, are especially ripe for corrupt
behavior. In pre–civil war Somalia, salaries were so low that officials had to
hold more than one job. Such a situation encourages bureaucrats to fall prey
to corrupt practices (Klitgaard 1988).
      An attempt should be made to reduce the overall number of employees
in the public sector.8 It would also be useful to adopt an incentive-based
wage policy for public officials, as Singapore and Hong Kong (China) have
done (Mookerjee 1995). In Singapore salaries in the public sector are higher
than those in the private sector, discouraging corruption (Mookerjee 1995).
It is also important to adopt a broad range of human resources measures,
including development of performance indicators and performance-based
incentive and promotion schemes.
Restructure Tax Administration Agencies
Tax administration agencies could be restructured functionally. The duties
of various functionaries within the VAT department should be streamlined,
with an eye to minimizing personal interactions with taxpayers (Purohit
2001a). Internal audits must also be strengthened. The selection of an audit
must be based on risk assessment based on information from local offices,
the results of audits conducted in the past, and the results of the computer
assessment of returns received in the department. It is equally important to
establish a wing of auditors specially trained to examine the accounts of ven-
dors. Checkposts must be abolished and enforcement strengthened.
Severely Punish Corrupt Officials
Punitive action against corrupt officials can have an important deterrent
effect. The role of the media is important in publicizing the punishment of
corrupt officials. Pecuniary penalties for corrupt behavior should be harsh
enough to discourage officials from engaging in wrongdoing.
      In addition to pecuniary penalties, in some severe cases of corruption,
tax evaders need to be publicly denounced or imprisoned. Stringent laws for
punishment of corrupt officials, along with the confiscation of property
amassed through bribery, will help reduce corruption. Such laws must apply
to domestic offenders and foreigners alike.

Use Information Technology to Combat Corruption
Many countries around the world, at all income levels, are attempting to use
information technology to combat administrative corruption (box 9.3). The
use of such technology reduces the discretionary power of local officials, cuts
transaction costs, and increases transparency. Most important, it reduces the
interaction between taxpayers and tax officials, thereby reducing the oppor-
tunity to engage in corrupt practices.
    The use of information technology automates government actions and
procedures, reducing delays and face-to-face contact. It builds transparency
    B O X 9 . 3 Using Information Technology to Streamline
    Services and Reduce Corruption in India
    The Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has used information technology to
    reduce corruption in several tax areas. The Computer-Aided Administration of
    Registration Department (CARD) replaces manual procedures that lacked
    transparency in property valuation and resulted in a flourishing business for
    brokers and middlemen, who exploited citizens buying or selling property.
    The CARD system replaces the manual services with computerized services
    and introduces several new services. It eliminates interaction with tax officers.
    It completes registration formalities within an hour, through electronic deliv-
    ery of all registration services. It improves the quality of services offered by
    providing a computer interface between citizens and the government.
          Eseva Kendra provides a one-stop venue for services of the state and
    central government departments and private businesses. It provides online
    transaction processing of various payments to government agencies and
    issues certificates needed by citizens and businesses. It connects citizens to
    departments and agencies such as the state VAT and other state taxes; the
    electricity, water, and telephone utilities; the passport office; municipal cor-
    porations; and the departments of transport, tourism, and health.
          All offices of India’s commercial tax department, including checkposts,
    have been computerized. Databases contain details regarding registered deal-
    ers, which can be analyzed and used for investigating evasion of the state VAT.
          Land records have also been revolutionized by computer technology.
    Until recently, obtaining land record documents was difficult and almost
    always required the help of middlemen. With the digitization of land records,
    farmers can now obtain land ownership certificates in 5–30 minutes from a
    Citizen Information Centre (CIC) at the Revenue Office. Computerization of this
    function has ensured transparency in the system and made the life of ordi-
    nary citizens easier. Farmers can now apply for mutation either at the CIC or
    over the Internet. They can also check the status of their request online and
    present documentary evidence to authorities if their request is not processed
    within the stipulated time period.

and trust by sharing information with the public and making them more
aware of their rights and privileges. It encourages greater accountability by
officials, as it creates disincentives for corruption by creating fear of exposure.
     Before introducing information technology, it is important to have a
completely integrated system of taxes. Data from tax returns of individuals
and corporations should be collected from the time of registration, continu-
ing up to the payment of tax and the processing of returns. Information from
the mainframe and data warehouse should be used to select cases for audit.
Results of investigations should also be recorded, and other agencies should
provide all necessary information. Such a system should maintain very tight
security and confidentiality, without which the information could be abused.
Set Up an Independent Anticorruption Organization
Many countries have set up anticorruption commissions (box 9.4). Some
are constitutionally independent of the executive branch; others are set up
by the executive branch to serve either in an advisory role or with the
     B O X 9 . 4 Using an Independent Agency to Combat Corruption
     The wide variety of anticorruption management structures suggests the
     diverse approaches for combating corruption in different countries. Hong
     Kong (China) established an Independent Commission against Corruption,
     which carries out investigative, preventive, and communications functions. It
     has enjoyed resounding success in fighting corruption: Hong Kong now ranks
     as one of the least corrupt jurisdictions in East Asia (www.transparency.org).
           India and Singapore established bodies devoted entirely to investigating
     corrupt acts and preparing evidence for prosecution. These bodies have also
     been successful in reducing corruption (Heilbrunn 2004; Vittal 2003).
           In New South Wales, commissions report to parliamentary committees;
     they are independent from the executive and judicial branches of state. These
     commissions have changed the norms of how business is conducted, pre-
     venting corruption from occurring (Heilbrunn 2004). The United States imple-
     mented a multiagency model that includes offices that are individually
     distinct but together form a web of agencies that fight corruption (Heilbrunn
     2004).
           The success of such organizations has encouraged governments else-
     where (in Argentina, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Guinea, the Republic of Korea, and
     Mauritius, for example) to create similar organizations. Mounting evidence sug-
     gests, however, that commissions have not been successful in countries where
     low levels of political commitment, lack of articulation among branches of
     state, and severe budgetary constraints have prevented the establishment of
     large and expensive anticorruption commissions (Heilbrunn 2004).
"
"196","                                            Corruption in Tax Administration  297
authority to investigate and help prosecute public officials at all levels.
Countries also use presidential commissions, multisectoral advisory
groups, institutions to administer ethical codes of conduct, special author-
ities or commissions to handle or investigate specific corruption allegations,
and other bodies.
Decentralize Government
Experience and theory suggest that an organization is most vulnerable to
corruption when bureaucrats enjoy a monopoly over taxpayers and take
actions that are difficult to monitor. The relation between the executive
branch and other participants in government, such as the legislature, the
judiciary, local jurisdictions, political parties, the media, the private sector,
and nongovernmental organizations, needs to be broadly articulated.
      Democratic systems offer a mechanism to minimize corruption by
introducing greater accountability and transparency in governance. When
local governments have some real power, they not only address local inter-
ests more authentically and confidently, they also exercise a check on the
operations of higher levels of authority. However, the effectiveness of decen-
tralized service delivery depends on the design of decentralization and the
institutional arrangement governing its implementation. An institutional
environment should provide political, administrative, and financial authority
to local governments, along with effective channels of local accountability and
central purview.
      Two key ingredients are needed for the potential gain to outweigh the
costs. First, decentralization must involve real delegation of authority,
including the authority to generate and reserve a portion of local revenues.
Second, local authorities must themselves be accountable to higher levels
and local groups. Abuse of authority and public corruption are less likely to
occur if the rules governing local officials are at least in part defined by local
norms (Charlick 1993).
Establish a Code of Ethics
At the national level, every country should have a comprehensive code of
ethics that spells out appropriate and inappropriate behavior for politicians
as well as bureaucrats. A leadership code of conduct is important, because
the country’s future prospects depend, to a very large extent, on the quality
and honesty of its leaders. The leadership code should describe the expected
and prohibited forms of conduct by government leaders (Kpundeh 1999;
Ruzindanda and Sedigh 1999). It should outline a broad concept of what
"
"197","298     Mahesh C. Purohit
constitutes leadership, emphasize the role of leaders in setting an example,
and identify principles of good leadership. It should include provisions that
check the misuse of state property through annual disclosure of leaders’
income, assets, and liabilities. At the same time, it should ban certain activ-
ities, such as seeking or accepting gifts or benefits relating to official duties
and personal interests; abusing government property; and misusing official
information not available to the public.
Provide Tax Officers with Ethics Training
Intensive training of officers in ethical conduct is of paramount importance,
even in countries that lack good governance (Huther and Shah 2001).
Course contents should include the laws and rules of the tax being admin-
istered and emphasize ethical values such as integrity, honesty, public service,
justice, transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. Training should be
repetitive in nature, followed up with refresher courses. Officers should be
aware of existing anticorruption measures, as well as their responsibilities
and the liability involved.
     A public ethics program can be carried out in several ways. Ethics man-
agement guidance can be offered by training tax officials. Ethics audit
research and inquiry can be conducted to assess their strengths and weak-
nesses. The objective of ethics maintenance is to make the ethical gains of
the agency sustainable. Assistance from anticorruption bodies, civil society
organizations, and private firms can be used to sustain best practices, as well
as to improve and monitor the effectiveness of public ethics programs. Tax-
payer education programs could be strengthened through interactive televi-
sion and radio programs and pamphlets.
Inform Taxpayers of Their Rights
Access to accurate information should be a right that is publicized adequately
so that taxpayers are aware of it. All tax rules, rates, and procedures should
be available on the Internet. Lack of access to information about rules and
regulations makes taxpayers unaware of their rights and exposes them to
discretionary treatment by corrupt officers.
Conclusions and Policy Recommendations
An irrational tax structure, monopoly and discretionary power in the hands
of government officials, a low degree of accountability or transparency in
"
"198","                                            Corruption in Tax Administration 299
administration, and interference by political leadership are the main causes
of corruption in tax administration. Low pay, the lack of severity of punish-
ment for corrupt behavior, poor-quality service, and greater politicization
of government also encourage corruption.
     The desired objectives of tax policy can be achieved only when it is
properly administered. In most developing countries, tax administration
is tax policy. Failure to properly administer the tax, therefore, defeats its
very purpose and threatens equity. Involved procedures cause deficiencies
in tax operations, reduce overall tax collection, and cause corruption in
tax administration.
     When corruption becomes a way of life, it has far-reaching implications.
It undercuts efficiency and equity, as well as the macroeconomic and insti-
tutional functions of government. It reduces revenue to government, endan-
gering fiscal sustainability, and adversely affects investment and growth. The
presence of corrupt officials encourages other officials to engage in corrup-
tion, because the probability of being detected or losing one’s reputation
declines. Likewise, the presence of corrupt taxpayers encourages other tax-
payers to cheat.
     Fighting corruption takes time. Power groups whose interests are
threatened can scuttle efforts. But letting corruption fester can be even
more dangerous. Which policy measures need to be adopted depends on
the overall social environment and the attitude about corruption held
by society.
     One of the most important policy prescriptions for curbing corruption
is creating a tax system that is rational, equitable, and simple. Reducing the
monopoly and discretionary power of tax officials is also very important.
The tax structure should be as broad as possible in order to maximize
equity. Bureaucrats should be given competing jurisdictions, so that com-
petition among officers will drive the level of bribes to zero. Monitoring and
auditing must be increased to prevent corruption. The system of recruitment
of officers should be streamlined, and officers should be given intensive and
repetitive training for promoting a code of conduct, with emphasis on ethical
values, such as integrity, honesty, public service, justice, transparency,
accountability, and rule of law. Salaries should be high enough that officials
are able to support themselves and their dependents without accepting
bribes. An anticorruption commission can be set up that maintains trans-
parency in the system and makes political leaders and officers accountable
for their actions. Decentralization can also help curb corruption. Its effec-
tiveness depends on the design of decentralization and the institutional
arrangements governing its implementation.

The author is grateful to R. J. Chelliah, Richard Bird, Tuan Minh Le, Pawan Aggarwal,
B. V. Kumar, T. R. Rustagi, Vivek Johari, Sudhir Krishna, Arun Kumar, D. N. Rao, and
V. K. Purohit for their very useful comments on the original draft of the chapter. Thanks
are also due to Madhulika Purohit for her competent research assistance in the course of
the preparation of this material. The author alone, however, remains responsible for the
errors, if any.
 1. Corruption is, of course, prevalent in the private sector, too.
 2. In Sierra Leone the All People’s Congress, the only political party from 1978 to 1992,
     totally controlled civil servants’ political views and associations. From the inception
     of the one-party system, neopatrimonial politics dictated that civil servants be party
     members. In return for their loyalty, civil servants were often shielded, pampered,
     and allowed to increase the range of their powers and pursue opportunities for self-
     enrichment (Kpundeh 1999).
 3. A 1999 survey conducted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-
     ment of some 3,000 enterprises in 20 transition economies revealed that “bribes” (a
     category that includes corrupt tax practices) act like a regressive tax. The bribe paid
     by smaller firms amounted to 5 percent of their annual revenue; bribes paid by
     medium-size firms amounted to 4 percent of their annual revenue, while those paid
     by larger firms amounted to slightly less than 3 percent of their annual revenue. The
     study reveals that smaller firms paid bribes more frequently than medium-size or
     larger firms (Asher n.d).
 4. The diversion of public resources, services, and assets to private use in Uganda
     resulted in deteriorating roads, poor medical facilities, dilapidated and ill-equipped
     schools, and falling educational standards (Ruzindana and Sedigh 1999).
 5. The international donor community jointly suspended aid to Tanzania in 1994,
     largely in response to massive irregularities in the tax system. Donors declared that
     they would not resume assistance until the government took steps to collect evaded
     tax, recover exempted tax, and initiate legal proceedings against corrupt tax officials
     (Sedigh and Muganda 1999).
 6. This scheme was introduced to identify potential taxpayers. It stipulated that a per-
     son having a credit card, owning a house, possessing a vehicle, paying an electricity
     bill of more than Rs. 50,000 a month, leaving the country during the year, or belong-
     ing to a club is obligated to file an income tax return (Aggarwal 1991). The scheme
     was eliminated in 2006–07.
 7. A more workable solution for making civil service salary competitive would be to
     focus on the performance-based component of gross pay, reflecting and rewarding
     each tax officer’s contribution to the success of anticorruption policies and higher
     collection rates (Pashev 2005).
 8. Uganda reduced the number of employees through a variety of measures. “Over-
     due leavers” (workers past retirement age, irregular entrants, and those identified
     through performance assessment as incompetent) and “ghost workers” (deceased
     workers, fictitious workers, or former employees who remained on the govern-
     ment payroll) were identified and eliminated. The “group employees’ scheme,”
     which allowed senior managers to recruit their own casual, short-term work-
     ers without reference to established job grades, was abolished. Surplus workers

                                          Background and Introduction
                Financial crimes are growing in sophistication and criminals accumulate significant
          sums of money through offences such as drug trafficking, investment fraud, extortion,
          corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and tax fraud. The nature of financial crime means
          that the same activity may violate a number of different laws. Different government
          agencies may be involved at various stages of tackling financial crimes, including the
          prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of offences and the recovery of the
          proceeds of crime. Tax offences are often intrinsically linked to other financial crimes as
          criminals fail to report their income from illicit activities for tax purposes. Conversely,
          criminals may over-report income in an attempt to launder the proceeds of crime. The
          Financial Action Task Force („FATF‟) has explicitly recognised the linkages between tax
          crimes and money laundering by adding tax crimes to the list of designated predicate
          offences for money laundering purposes in the 2012 update of its Recommendations.
                Where criminal activity does cross national boundaries, the amounts involved can be
          staggering. A 2011 UNODC report1 estimates that in 2000 to 2009 total proceeds from
          transnational organised crime was the equivalent of 1.5% of global GDP, or 870bn USD
          in 2009. Issues of financial crime are of concern to all countries, but particularly to
          developing countries. Illicit financial flows resulting from financial crimes strip resources
          from developing countries that could finance their long-term development. Although it is
          difficult to estimate the total amounts at stake, experts agree that the amounts at stake are
          vast.
                The OECD has been active in this area for many years. As early as 1998 work was
          initiated in response to a call by G7 Finance Ministers which encouraged international
          action to enhance the capacity of anti-money laundering systems to deal effectively with
          tax related crimes. The OECD and the FATF subsequently strengthened co-operation in
          areas of mutual concern and, since 2003, the OECD has held Observer status at FATF
          meetings. In July 2009, the G8 Leaders called for further efforts in combating illicit
          financing, and acknowledged the progress being made by the FATF in improving the
          standards for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism and by the
          OECD on international standards of transparency.
                In its 20092 and 20103 Recommendations, the OECD advocated greater co-operation
          and better information sharing between different government agencies involved in the
          fight against financial crimes both domestically and internationally. These

"208","6 – BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION
          recommendations are reproduced in the box at the end of this chapter. The OECD has
          also developed practical guidance in the form of handbooks to better enable tax officials
          to detect bribes and instances of money laundering. 4 These handbooks have been
          translated into many languages and are being used by tax administrations around the
          world.
                It was against this backdrop that Norway hosted the first Tax and Crime Forum held
          in Oslo in March 2011. The purpose of the Forum was to find more effective ways to use
          a „whole-of-government‟ approach to counter financial crimes by harnessing the skills
          and knowledge of different agencies through better domestic and international
          co-operation. Inter-agency co-operation can enhance financial integrity and good
          governance by improving the effectiveness of countries‟ abilities to fight financial crimes.
          In a world where criminals operate in a complex financial environment and across
          geographic boundaries, effective domestic and international inter-agency co-operation is
          the only viable response. The Forum asked the OECD, working with other international
          organisations and interested parties, to focus on improving inter-agency co-operation by
          mapping out different models of co-operation, their advantages and challenges with a
          view to developing best practice standards, and with a particular focus on the contribution
          that tax administrations can make in this regard. The importance of inter-agency
          co-operation was also underlined by the G20 Finance Ministers Communiqué of February
          2012, which calls for an update by the OECD, together with the FATF, on steps taken to
          prevent the misuse of corporate vehicles and improve interagency co-operation in the
          fight against illicit activities.
                This report describes the current position with respect to domestic inter-agency
          co-operation in 32 countries.5 The report, prepared by the Task Force on Tax Crimes and
          Other Crimes (TFTC), was presented and released at the second Forum on Tax and Crime
          held in Rome on 14-15 June 2012.
                This report is not an end point but the beginning of a series. Financial crime is an
          issue for all countries around the world. Future work may be conducted to enlarge the
          country coverage and to further deepen the level of analysis, with a view to providing
          maximum insights into the most effective ways of fighting financial crimes. For example,
          co-operation between the customs administration and other agencies may be analysed.
          Further reports may also be prepared to measure progress and enable countries to
          benchmark their systems internationally. The ongoing objective is to identify ways in
          which agencies can work together in combating financial crime to deliver better results,
          in shorter time frames and with lower costs. Improvements on domestic inter-agency
          co-operation will also have a positive impact on cross-border international co-operation.
          While this report is limited to domestic co-operation, future reports may also cover
          aspects of international co-operation, a topic on which work is also underway in the
          TFTC.

                   Box. 1 Recommendation of the OECD Council to Facilitate Co-operation
             between Tax and Other Law Enforcement Authorities to Combat Serious Crimes
                                                        14 October 2010
            THE COUNCIL
            Having regard to Article 5 b) of the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
            and Development of 14 December 1960;
            Having regard to the Recommendation of the Council on Tax Measures for Further Combating
            Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions;
            Having regard to the Recommendation of the Council concerning the Model Tax Convention on
            Income and on Capital (hereafter the “OECD Model Tax Convention”)
            Having regard to the Conclusions of the 2010 meeting of the Council at Ministerial level and the
            Declaration on Propriety, Integrity and Transparency in the Conduct of International Business
            and Finance
            Having regard to the Conclusions of the 2009 meeting of the Council at Ministerial level;
            Having regard to the FATF 40 Recommendations and nine Special Recommendations;
            Having regard to the 2009 OECD Money Laundering Awareness Handbook for Tax Examiners
            and Tax Auditors;
            Considering that tax authorities can play an important role in the detection of all serious crimes
            and not only foreign bribery;
            Considering that sharing information by tax authorities with other law enforcement authorities
            can advance efforts to detect, investigate and prosecute serious crimes;
            On the proposal of the Committee on Fiscal Affairs;
            I.    RECOMMENDS that Members establish, in accordance with their legal systems, an
            effective legal and administrative framework and provide guidance to facilitate reporting by tax
            authorities of suspicions of serious crimes, including money laundering and terrorism financing,
            arising out of the performance of their duties, to the appropriate domestic law enforcement
            authorities.
            II. FURTHER RECOMMENDS that Members consider to include in their bilateral tax
            treaties, the optional language of paragraph 12.3 of the Commentary to Article 26 of the OECD
            Model Tax Convention, which allows “the sharing of tax information by tax authorities with
            other law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities on certain high priority matters (e.g. to
            combat money laundering, corruption, terrorism financing)” and reads as follows:
            “Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for
            other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of
            both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.”
            III. INVITES non-Members to adhere to this Recommendation.
            IV. ENCOURAGES all countries to distribute widely within their tax administrations the
            2009 OECD Money Laundering Awareness Handbook for Tax Examiners and Tax Auditors.
            V. INSTRUCTS the Committee on Fiscal Affairs to monitor the implementation of the
            Recommendation and to promote it in the context of contacts with non-Members and to report to
            Council as appropriate.

                                                           25 May 2009
            THE COUNCIL,
            Having regard to Article 5, b) of the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
            and Development of 14 December 1960;
            Having regard to the Recommendation of the Council on the Tax Deductibility of Bribes to
            Foreign Public Officials (hereafter the ""1996 Recommendation""), to which the present
            Recommendation succeeds;
            Having regard to the Revised Recommendation of the Council on Bribery in International
            Business Transactions;
            Having regard to the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
            International Business Transactions to which all OECD Members and eight non-members are
            Parties, as at the time of the adoption of this Recommendation (hereafter the ""OECD

            Having regard to the Recommendation of the Council concerning the Model Tax Convention on
            Income and on Capital (hereafter the ""OECD Model Tax Convention"");
            Welcoming the United Nations Convention Against Corruption to which most parties to the
            OECD Anti-Bribery Convention are State parties, and in particular Article 12.4, which provides
            that ""Each State Party shall disallow the tax deductibility of expenses that constitute bribes"";
            Considering that the 1996 Recommendation has had an important impact both within and
            outside the OECD, and that significant steps have already been taken by governments, the
            private sector and non-governmental agencies to combat the bribery of foreign public officials,
            but that the problem still continues to be widespread and necessitates strengthened measures;
            Considering that explicit legislation disallowing the deductibility of bribes increases the overall
            awareness within the business community of the illegality of bribery of foreign public officials
            and within the tax administration of the need to detect and disallow deductions for payments of
            bribes to foreign public officials; and
            Considering that sharing information by tax authorities with other law enforcement authorities
            can be an important tool for the detection and investigation of transnational bribery offences;
            On the proposal of the Committee on Fiscal Affairs and the Investment Committee;
            I.    RECOMMENDS that:
                  (i) Member countries and other Parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention explicitly
                  disallow the tax deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials, for all tax purposes in an
                  effective manner. Such disallowance should be established by law or by any other binding
                  means which carry the same effect, such as:
                  •     Prohibiting tax deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials;
                  •     Prohibiting tax deductibility of all bribes or expenditures incurred in furtherance of
                  corrupt conduct in contravention of the criminal law or any other laws of the Party to the
                  Anti-Bribery Convention.

             Box 2. Recommendation of the Council on Tax Measures for Further Combating
                 Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions
                                                      25 May 2009 (cont.)
            Denial of tax deductibility is not contingent on the opening of an investigation by the law
            enforcement authorities or of court proceedings.
                 (ii) Each Member country and other Party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention review,
                 on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of its legal, administrative and policy frameworks as
                 well as practices for disallowing tax deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials.
                 These reviews should assess whether adequate guidance is provided to taxpayers and tax
                 authorities as to the types of expenses that are deemed to constitute bribes to foreign public
                 officials, and whether such bribes are effectively detected by tax authorities.
                 (ii) Each Member country and other Party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention review,
                 on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of its legal, administrative and policy frameworks as
                 well as practices for disallowing tax deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials.

                 officials, and whether such bribes are effectively detected by tax authorities.
                 (iii) Member countries and other Parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention consider
                 to include in their bilateral tax treaties, the optional language of paragraph 12.3 of the
                 Commentary to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which allows ""the sharing
                 of tax information by tax authorities with other law enforcement agencies and judicial
                 authorities on certain high priority matters (e.g. to combat money laundering, corruption,
                 terrorism financing)"" and reads as follows:
            ""Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for
            other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of
            both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.""
            II. Further RECOMMENDS Member countries and other Parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery
            Convention, in accordance with their legal systems, to establish an effective legal and
            administrative framework and provide guidance to facilitate reporting by tax authorities of
            suspicions of foreign bribery arising out of the performance of their duties, to the appropriate
            domestic law enforcement authorities.
            III. INVITES non-members that are not yet Parties to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention to
            apply this Recommendation to the fullest extent possible.
            IV. INSTRUCTS the Committee on Fiscal Affairs together with the Investment Committee to
            monitor the implementation of the Recommendation and to promote it in the context of contacts
            with non-members and to report to Council as appropriate.

                                                            Chapter 1
                                   Key Findings and Recommendations
A. In general
               The report identifies key agencies involved in the different stages of combating
          financial crime. It considers the organisational models for these agencies adopted in
          different countries. These models form the framework around which arrangements for
          inter-agency co-operation are built. Taking into account the different agency models
          applied, the report identifies flows of information that are particularly important in
          enabling these agencies to operate effectively in combating financial crime. It describes
          the broad position with respect to the existence of legal gateways in countries to enable
          these flows to take place, as well as any particular barriers or impediments that exist.
          While the ability to share information is a necessary condition for inter-agency
          co-operation, many countries have gone further and have put in place enhanced forms of
          co-operation to make optimal use of these gateways and the report describes the
          arrangements for enhanced co-operation currently in place.
B. Organisational models for agencies fighting tax crimes and other financial crime
               Strategies for combating financial crimes comprise a number of key stages, including
          the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of offences, and the recovery of
          the proceeds of crime. Depending upon the circumstances, these strategies can involve a
          number of government agencies, including the tax administration; the customs
          administration; anti-money laundering authorities including the Financial Intelligence
          Unit („FIU‟); the police and specialised law enforcement agencies; the public prosecutor‟s
          office; and financial regulators.
               A range of organisational models exist for structuring each of these agencies and
          allocating competences among them. Some of these models are long-standing and were
          established as a country‟s framework for law enforcement was developed. Other models
          reflect more recent policy decisions. Each organisational model has distinct features
          which need to be taken into account when developing strategies for inter-agency
          co-operation, so as to ensure that the full benefits of co-operation are achieved. Which
          agency has responsibility for a particular activity will directly impact the processes and
          agreements required to achieve a desired benefit from co-operation.
               For instance, looking at ways countries have allocated responsibilities for countering
          tax crime the Report identifies the following four models:
                Model 1: the tax administration has responsibility for directing and conducting
                 investigations. This model is applied in Australia, Canada, Germany, Greece,
                 India, Ireland, Korea, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland, the United
                 Kingdom and the United States.

"214","12 – CHAPTER 1 – KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
                Model 2: the tax administration has responsibility for conducting investigations,
                 under the direction of the public prosecutor. This model is applied in Austria, Chile,
                 the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and the United States. In Spain
                 investigations are currently directed by an examining judge.
                Model 3: a specialist tax agency, under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance
                 but outside the tax administration, has responsibility for conducting investigations.
                 This model is applied in Greece, Iceland and Turkey.
                Model 4: the police or public prosecutor has responsibility for conducting
                 investigations. This model is applied in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
                 Finland, France, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, the Slovak Republic
                 and Slovenia.
               Italy is not included in the four models set out above. In Italy, responsibility for
          carrying out investigations into financial crimes, including tax crimes, sits with the
          Guardia di Finanza, which can conduct such investigations both independently and also
          under the direction of the public prosecutor. The Guardia di Finanza is also able to carry
          out civil tax investigations and audits in accordance with its own administrative powers.
          The United States is included in both Model 1 and Model 2, to reflect two types of
          criminal investigations. The first is an administrative investigation, which is conducted by
          a tax administration employee and the case is then referred to a prosecutor. The second is
          a Grand Jury investigation which is initiated and worked under the direction of a
          prosecutor from the inception of the investigation. In Greece, tax offences may be
          investigated by the tax administration or by the Economic Crimes Enforcement Agency
          (SDOE), which sits under the Ministry of Finance. Greece is therefore included under
          both Model 1 and Model 3.
C. Models for sharing information
               In the course of their activities, different government agencies collect and hold
          information on individuals, corporations and transactions which may be directly relevant
          to the activities of other agencies in combating financial crime. Mechanisms to enable
          this information to be shared improve the prevention and detection of financial offences,
          enable investigations to be conducted more effectively and efficiently, result in faster and
          more successful prosecutions, and increase the likelihood of the proceeds of crime being
          recovered. In order for information to be shared, legal gateways must exist between the
          relevant agencies. Conditions and exceptions can be applied to different forms of
          arrangement and gateways may provide for different arrangements to apply in different
          circumstances. Under all types of co-operation with respect to sharing information among
          different agencies, it is important to protect the confidentiality of information and the
          integrity of work carried out by other agencies. The Report identifies four different types
          of co-operation with respect to sharing information among different agencies: (i) direct
          access to information contained in agency records or databases; (ii) an obligation to
          provide information spontaneously (sometimes expressed as a „reporting obligation‟); (iii)
          an ability, but not an obligation, to provide information spontaneously; and (iv) an
          obligation or ability to provide information only on request.

               On this basis, countries provided information on their current legal gateways for
          information sharing, placing them in categories 0 to 4. This report analyses the existence
          of gateways which allow, oblige or prevent the tax administration, the police (and related
          law enforcement agencies), the FIU and financial regulators to share information with
          other agencies in certain situations. It analyses 13 possible flows of information.
               The analysis is not meant to be an evaluation of the effectiveness of the gateways in a
          given country, but simply represents an overview of the legal gateways that are in place.
          In addition, it does not necessarily indicate that in all cases a legal gateway in one
          category is in practice more effective than one in another category. For example,
          spontaneous sharing of information may be very effective when there is a long-standing
          co-operative relationship between the agencies involved, and there is a clear
          understanding of what information may be useful in the activities of the recipient agency.
          On the other hand, direct access to information may be less effective in cases where
          officials are unfamiliar with the information available or have not received appropriate
          training in using systems operated by the other agency.
               Based on the results of this analysis, the following key findings have been identified
          in relation to inter-agency sharing of information:
Information held by the tax administration
                All countries have legal gateways to enable the tax administration to share
                 information obtained for the purpose of a civil tax audit or assessment with agencies
                 conducting tax crime investigations.
                There appear to be barriers to the ability of tax administrations to share information
                 with the police or public prosecutor in non-tax investigations, with two countries
                 imposing an explicit prohibition on the tax administration from providing
                 information relevant to non-tax offences.
                The position is mixed regarding the ability of tax administrations to share tax
                 information with the FIU, with four countries expressly prohibiting the FIU from
                 obtaining tax information.
Information held by the police or public prosecutor
                In most countries legal gateways enable the police or public prosecutor to provide
                 information to the tax administration for the purpose of administering taxes, though
                 there is often no obligation on them to do so.
                There are appropriate gateways in most countries to enable the police or public
                 prosecutor to provide relevant information to agencies conducting tax crime
                 investigations.
                Legal gateways are available in almost all countries to enable the FIU to obtain
                 relevant information from the police or public prosecutor, with one country imposing
                 a prohibition. These gateways broadly reflect the FIU organisational model and there
                 are greater obligations on the police to share information with the FIU where the FIU
                 is established as a division of the police force.

"216","14 – CHAPTER 1 – KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Information held by the Financial Intelligence Unit
                The position with respect to the availability to the tax administration of FIU
                 information for the purpose of making tax assessments varies significantly: some
                 countries give the tax administration direct access or require the FIU to provide
                 relevant information while nine countries impose an express prohibition on the FIU
                 providing any information.
                On the other hand, legal gateways are in place in most countries to enable FIUs to
                 provide information concerning possible tax offences to the agency responsible for
                 investigating tax crimes, though in many cases the FIU is able to exercise discretion
                 in deciding whether to provide information.
                All countries provide legal gateways to enable the FIU to provide information
                 concerning suspected non-tax offences to the police or public prosecutor. The type of
                 gateway used appears to be influenced by the FIU organisational model.
Information held by financial regulators
                Financial regulators are generally not obliged to provide information to tax
                 administrations for the purpose of assessing taxes, and a number of countries impose
                 an express prohibition on doing so.
                Legal gateways exist in most countries to enable financial regulators to provide
                 information concerning suspected tax offences to the agency responsible for
                 investigations.
                All countries have legal gateways for financial regulators to provide information to
                 the police or public prosecutor with respect to suspected non-tax offences or (with
                 the exception of one country) to the FIU with respect to suspected money laundering
                 or terrorist financing activity, though in some cases this information may only be
                 shared on request.
               The following successful practices have been identified.
                Co-ordinated response to Suspicious Transaction Reports (Ireland and Turkey):
                 Legislation in Ireland requires financial institutions and other reporting entities to submit
                 Suspicious Transaction Reports to both the tax administration and the FIU, and broad
                 legal gateways permit the agencies to share information. Following the introduction of
                 the requirement to submit Suspicious Transaction reports to the tax administration in
                 2003, the Irish Revenue carried out extensive discussions with financial institutions.
                 These emphasised the obligation to submit Suspicious Transaction Reports where there
                 were suspicions of money laundering and the predicate offence was a possible tax crime.
                 This campaign was successful and contributed to an increase in Suspicious Transaction
                 Reports submitted from approximately 3 000 in 2003, to 5 000 in 2004 and 14 000 in
                 2008. Approximately 80% of Suspicious Transaction Reports received relate to possible
                 tax offences. Since 2003, the Irish tax administration has settled 578 civil tax
                 assessments supported by information contained in Suspicious Transaction reports, with
                 additional tax revenue raised of EUR60.1 million. There are currently 25 tax crime
                 prosecutions ongoing in Ireland, which were initiated from information in Suspicious

                 Transaction Reports. Specialists from the FIU and the tax administration meet regularly
                 to discuss their analyses of Suspicious Transaction Reports and to co-ordinate
                 investigations where evidence exists of both tax and non-tax offences, as well as discuss
                 broader operational issues related to money laundering investigations. The FIU and tax
                 administration also each attend feedback for between the other agency and businesses
                 required to submit Suspicious Transaction Reports. This ensures the agencies display a
                 united front in their dealings with the public.
                 In Turkey, in 2009 and 2010 the FIU received Suspicious Transaction Reports
                 related to possible usury carried out using Point of Sale (POS) machines. Specialists
                 within the FIU analysed these reports and determined that, in addition to usury, the
                 predicate offences underlying the Suspicious Transaction Reports included possible
                 tax crimes. The FIU immediately shared its analysis with the Tax Inspection Board,
                 which conducts tax crime investigations in Turkey. The Board started a number of
                 investigations, during which officials identified additional unreported taxable
                 income and evidence of tax offences. The Tax Inspection Board shared the results of
                 its investigations with the FIU, which resulted in the FIU submitting the case to the
                 public prosecutor‟s office for prosecution of money laundering offences.
              Access to Suspicious Transaction Reports for the tax administration
                 (Australia): In Australia, the tax administration has a right of access to all FIU
                 information, including direct access to all Suspicious Transaction Reports, via a
                 secure online connection. This may be used for any purpose relating to the
                 administration of taxes and the enforcement of tax law. The FIU also provides the
                 tax administration with complete data sets of Suspicious Transaction Report
                 information, which the tax administration uses in its automated data matching and
                 data mining programmes.
              Access to tax information for the Financial Intelligence Unit and co-operation
                 with regulators (Italy): The Italian FIU has direct access to the Anagrafe dei Conti
                 („Account and Deposit Register‟) maintained by the tax administration, which
                 includes information on accounts and financial transactions carried out by financial
                 intermediaries. Since 2009, information obtained by the FIU from the Anagrafe dei
                 Conti has been extremely useful. In particular, this information has been used in
                 analyzing Suspicious Transaction Reports, improving international co-operation by
                 providing information to be shared with overseas FIUs, and in enhancing the
                 effectiveness of inspections and audits, especially those with respect to non-
                 co-operative financial intermediaries. Legislation has also been passed which allows
                 the Italian FIU direct access to the Anagrafe Tributaria („Tax Register‟) which, once
                 implemented, will allow the FIU access to information on the tax information of
                 Italian taxpayers. The Italian FIU has signed memoranda of understanding with the
                 Bank of Italy and the Insurance Supervisory Authority setting out obligations for the
                 bodies to share information and to co-operate in combating money laundering and
                 ensuring effective supervision. A further memorandum of understanding is currently
                 under negotiation between the FIU and Securities Supervisory Authority. The Italian
                 FIU works closely with the Guardia di Finanza and 97 per cent of Suspicious
                 Transaction Reports are submitted to the Guardia di Finanza for investigation into
                 suspected money laundering or tax evasion. Investigations and audits of
                 non-co-operative financial intermediaries may also be delegated by the FIU to the
                 Guardia di Finanza.

"218","16 – CHAPTER 1 – KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
              Use of covenants to improve co-operation between the tax administration and
                 police (the Netherlands): Police in the Netherlands may obtain information held by
                 the tax administration‟s tax compliance and audit areas only where an actual
                 criminal investigation is underway and a formal request is submitted. However, the
                 police and tax administration have entered into covenants that operate as permanent
                 requests for information. The impact of this is that the tax administration can, in
                 effect, provide information spontaneously. In the Netherlands, covenants are also
                 used to facilitate co-operation with other agencies, including financial regulators,
                 public prosecutors and municipalities. Examples of arrangements to share
                 information using covenants include the Real Estate Intelligence Centre, Financial
                 Expertise Centre and Regional Information and Expertise Centres, outlined in
                 Chapter 4.
              An integrated approach between tax administration and police (France): In
                 France, the Brigade Nationale d’Enquêtes Économiques („BNEE‟) is a unit of
                 around 50 tax inspectors that work within the judicial police forces and assist in
                 criminal investigations, as a liaison with the tax administration. In 2010 the Brigade
                 Nationale de Répression de la Délinquance Fiscale („BNRDF‟) was established as
                 an agency with specific police and tax skills to combat serious tax offences.
D. Models for enhanced co-operation
               Sharing information is a necessary condition for inter-agency co-operation in
          combating financial crime. However, countries may go further and develop operational
          models that make the most effective use of gateways. Several countries have done so and
          have developed models for enhanced co-operation which enable agencies to work
          together to their mutual benefit. These models should not be viewed in isolation, but as
          forming part of a coherent strategy, which involves agencies moving in the same
          direction to a common goal. Although there is no limit to the ways in which agencies are
          capable of working together, and countries should consider new and innovative methods
          based on their needs and experiences, the report identifies a number of main models,
          namely:
                Joint investigation teams: these enable agencies with a common interest to work
                 together in an investigation. In addition to sharing information, this enables an
                 investigation team to draw on a wider range of skills and experience from
                 investigators with different backgrounds and training. Joint investigations may avoid
                 duplication arising from parallel investigations, and increase efficiency by enabling
                 officials from each agency to focus on different aspects of an investigation,
                 depending upon their experience and legal powers. In some cases, gateways for
                 sharing information are wider when agencies are engaged in a joint investigation
                 than they would be in other circumstances. Countries that make use of these
                 strategies include Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, India, Japan,
                 Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Slovenia, Turkey and the
                 United States.
                Inter-agency centres of intelligence: these are typically established to centralise
                 processes for information gathering and analysis for a number of agencies. They can
                 focus on a specific geographic area or type of criminal activity, or have a wider role
                 in information sharing. These centres conduct analyses based on primary research as

"219","                                                                             CHAPTER 1 – KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS – 17
                 well as information obtained from agencies. In some cases they access data through
                 gateways available to participating agencies, while in other cases they have specific
                 information gathering powers. By centralising these activities, officials within a
                 centre gain experience of particular legal and practical issues, and specialised
                 systems can be developed, which can increase their effectiveness. Cost savings may
                 also be achieved, as the expense of collecting, processing and analysing data can be
                 shared between participating agencies. Countries that make use of these strategies
                 include Australia, Finland, India, the Netherlands, Sweden and the
                 United States.
                Secondments and co-location of personnel: these are an effective way of enabling
                 skills to be transferred while allowing personnel to build contacts with their
                 counterparts in another agency. Seconded officials share their skills, experience and
                 specialist knowledge while participating directly in the work of the host agency.
                 Countries report that arrangements to co-locate and second staff have wider benefits
                 for inter-agency co-operation, by encouraging officials to be more proactive in
                 engaging with counterparts from other agencies and improving the effectiveness of
                 co-operation that does take place. Countries that make use of these strategies include
                 Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the
                 Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
                Other models: other strategies include the use of shared databases, dissemination of
                 strategic intelligence products such as newsletters and intelligence briefs, joint
                 committees to co-ordinate policy in areas of shared responsibility, and inter-agency
                 meetings and training sessions to share information on trends in financial crime,
                 guidance on investigative techniques and best practice in managing cases. Countries
                 that make use of these strategies include Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech
                 Republic, Finland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
                 New Zealand, the Slovak Republic, South Africa, Turkey and the United States.
E. Recommendations
               The whole-of-government approach to combating financial crime involves
          recognising that the activities of separate agencies do not operate in isolation. Officials in
          agencies including the tax administration, the customs administration, the FIU, the police
          and specialised criminal law enforcement agencies, the public prosecutor‟s office, and
          financial regulators recognise that the knowledge and skills required to combat financial
          crime are often spread across each of these agencies.
               Barriers to effective inter-agency co-operation prevent agencies responsible for
          combating financial crime from obtaining the benefit of this knowledge and skills. These
          barriers fall into three broad groups: legal; operational and political. Legal barriers
          include specific restrictions and prohibitions which apply to prevent an agency obtaining
          access to relevant information. Operational barriers include complex or lengthy
          procedures for obtaining information from another agency, a lack of awareness of the
          availability of information or other mechanisms for co-operation, or a lack of specialist
          training which reduces the effectiveness of gateways which do exist. Political barriers
          include a lack of support for agencies to adopt a whole-of-government approach, or to
          make the changes required to remove or reduce legal and operational barriers.

"220","18 – CHAPTER 1 – KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
               Countries‟ strategies have to operate within the broader context of their legal system,
          administrative practice and culture. It is up to each country to decide how to approach the
          issues addressed in this report and what strategies would be the most appropriate in the
          context of, and the most consistent with, its rules and framework.
               It is against this background that this report recommends that countries:
           1.    Review their models for sharing information among different agencies, in particular
                 as regards:
                the ability of the tax administration to share information with agencies such as the
                   police and the FIU;
                the possibility of introducing an obligation for the tax administration to report to
                   the relevant law enforcement agency or the FIU evidence of any serious offence,
                   suspected money laundering or terrorist financing activities, and to share
                   information relevant to investigations into these offences or activities; and
                the ability of any agency which holds information relevant to the administration
                   and assessment of taxes to make this information available to the tax
                   administration. This applies in particular to information contained in Suspicious
                   Transaction Reports. It is recommended that the tax administration be provided
                   such information through direct access or through spontaneous exchange, as
                   appropriate and applicable. In the latter case the FIU should have officials who are
                   trained and experienced in recognising potential tax issues.
           2.    Review the models for enhanced co-operation described in this report, with a view to
                 introducing and adapting them, as well as developing innovative models based on
                 their particular needs, legal framework and experience. They should also consider
                 ways in which processes for co-operation can be made more effective within existing
                 frameworks.
           3.    Review the examples of successful practices identified in this report, with a view to
                 introducing similar practices based on their particular needs, legal framework and
                 experience. Where a particular successful practice is not appropriate because of a
                 country‟s legal framework, it should consider alternative ways in which comparable
                 benefits can be achieved.
           4.    Evaluate the legal and operational ability of the tax administration to be involved in
                 tax crime investigations, where these are conducted by other agencies. Countries
                 should explore ways to remove potential barriers, and consider requiring increased
                 participation in investigations by tax officials, taking into account the peculiarities of
                 the different organisational models discussed in the report.
           5.    Evaluate their mechanisms for co-operation on a recurrent basis. This evaluation
                 should be informed by the experience of officers directly involved in co-operation,
                 as well as an objective assessment of the results of inter-agency co-operation models
                 implemented.

                                                      Box 3. Key Findings
              Strategies for combating financial crimes comprise a number of critical stages, including
                 the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of offences, and the recovery of the
                 proceeds of crime.
              Key government agencies involved in combating financial crimes include the tax
                 administration; the customs administration; anti-money laundering authorities including the
                 Financial Intelligence Unit („FIU‟); the police and specialised law enforcement agencies;
                 the public prosecutor‟s office; and financial regulators.
              Countries apply different organisational models in structuring each of these agencies. Some
                 of these models are long-standing and were established as a country‟s framework for law
                 enforcement was developed. Other models reflect more recent policy decisions.
              Each organisational model has distinct features which need to be taken into account when
                 developing strategies for inter-agency co-operation, so as to ensure that the full benefits of
                 co-operation are achieved. Which agency has responsibility for a particular activity will
                 directly impact the processes and agreements required to achieve a desired benefit from
                 co-operation.
              In the area of tax crimes, there are four different models which countries have adopted to
                 investigate these crimes. Under Model 1, the tax administration has responsibility for
                 directing and conducting investigations. Under Model 2, the tax administration has
                 responsibility for conducting investigations, under the direction of the public prosecutor.
                 Under Model 3, a specialist tax agency under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance but
                 outside the tax administration has responsibility for conducting investigations. Under
                 Model 4, the police or public prosecutor has responsibility for conducting investigations.
               Financial crime covers a broad range of offences, including tax evasion and tax fraud,
          money laundering, corruption, insider trading, bankruptcy fraud and terrorist financing.
          Many different government agencies may be involved in the prevention, detection,
          investigation and prosecution of these crimes and the recovery of the proceeds of crime.
          These include agencies such as police forces and prosecution authorities, which have a
          visible role in law enforcement. They also include agencies such as tax and customs
          administrations and financial regulators, which in the course of their normal activities
          collect and hold significant information about individuals, corporations and financial
          transactions. Each of these agencies may hold operational and strategic information
          relevant to the activities of other agencies in combating financial crime. Operational
          information is that which is relevant to specific cases and investigations. Strategic
          information relates to the identification of risks and threats and is not specific to a
          particular case.

"222","20 – CHAPTER 2 – ORGANISATIONAL MODELS FOR AGENCIES FIGHTING FINANCIAL CRIME
                There is no single approach to how countries structure these agencies. Activities
          which are the responsibility of a particular agency in one country may be the
          responsibility of a different agency in a second country. Similarly, some countries may
          establish a number of independent agencies to carry out activities which in other countries
          are the responsibility of a single larger body. Understanding these differences is important
          to appreciate the implications of similarities and differences between countries‟
          arrangements for domestic inter-agency co-operation. Which agency has responsibility
          for a particular activity will directly impact the processes and agreements required to
          achieve a desired benefit from co-operation. For example, whether responsibility for
          investigating tax fraud lies with the tax administration, the police or a specific tax
          investigations authority directly impacts the arrangements with other agencies required to
          facilitate these investigations.
                The following paragraphs describe in general terms the role of different agencies in
          the countries covered by this report.
A. Tax administration
                A country‟s tax administration is responsible for the assessment and collection of
          taxes on behalf of the government. This involves gathering and processing information on
          individuals and corporations subject to tax, including personal details, property
          ownership, investments, financial transactions and business operations. Tax
          administrations employ large numbers of trained specialists and investigators with
          experience in auditing and analysing financial data and investigating suspicious or
          anomalous transactions. Tax administrations often have extensive powers to access
          information and documentation from taxpayers and third parties. They typically play a
          central role in preventing and detecting tax crime. Once the suspicion of a tax crime
          exists, countries apply different models to determine the extent to which a tax
          administration may be involved in a subsequent investigation and prosecution.6
                Models for comparing tax administrations could be based on a number of criteria. For
          the purposes of this report, the relevant criteria are those which might influence a tax
          administration‟s role in combating financial crime, and the ability of the tax
          administration (or other agency investigating tax crimes) to obtain information relevant to
          an investigation from other agencies. The Models applied below identify the agency
          which generally has responsibility for conducting investigations into tax offences. This is
          important in understanding which agency may require information for the purposes of
          conducting an investigation. The Models also identify those countries where these
          investigations are directed by a public prosecutor, and where they are wholly the
          responsibility of the investigating agency. This may be relevant in identifying additional
          gateways for obtaining relevant information, at the level of the prosecutor. Based on these
          criteria, four models have been identified as applying in the countries covered by this
          report in countering tax crimes. These are set out in the table below.
           6.
              Tax administrations may in some cases also act in a supervisory capacity, monitoring compliance
           with money laundering regulations by businesses in certain sectors including real estate agents and
           traders accepting large cash payments. For example, this is the case in Luxembourg, the
           Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

                Under Models 1 and 2, tax crime investigations are conducted by the tax
          administration, often through a specialist criminal investigations division. Under Model 1,
          the tax administration also directs investigations. The public prosecutor‟s office does not
          have a direct role in investigations, though a prosecutor may provide advice to
          investigators with respect to matters such as legal process and the laws of evidence.
          Under Model 2 on the other hand, investigations conducted by the tax administration are
          directed by public prosecutors or, exceptionally, examining judges. In Model 3, tax crime
          investigations are conducted by a specialist tax agency, which is under the supervision of
          the Ministry of Finance but outside the tax administration. Under Model 4, investigations
          are conducted by the police or public prosecutor. The Model under which a country is
          listed reflects the general practice in the country. In a number of cases, tax investigations
          which have particular features may be referred to another agency for investigation.

           * In Spain, tax crime investigations are currently directed by an examining judge.
                In 12 countries the tax administration has responsibility for directing and conducting
          tax crime investigations. These include all eight common law countries considered in this
          report. The United States is included in the table above twice, to reflect two types of
          criminal investigations. The first is an administrative investigation, which is conducted by
          a tax administration employee and the case is then referred to a prosecutor (Model 1). The
          second is a Grand Jury investigation which is initiated and worked under the direction of
          a prosecutor from the inception of the investigation (Model 2). In Greece, tax
          investigations may be conducted by the tax administration or by the Economic Crimes
          Enforcement Agency (SDOE). Greece is therefore shown under both Model 1 and
          Model 3.
                In seven countries, tax crime investigations are conducted by the tax administration
          but directed by a public prosecutor or, in the case of Spain, an examining judge.

"224","22 – CHAPTER 2 – ORGANISATIONAL MODELS FOR AGENCIES FIGHTING FINANCIAL CRIME
               In 14 countries, including the majority of civil law jurisdictions, tax crime
          investigations are conducted outside the tax administration. In three countries
          investigations are conducted by specialist tax investigations agencies that sit under the
          Ministry of Finance but outside the tax administration. In Turkey, the majority of tax
          crime investigations are directed and conducted by the Tax Inspection Board. However,
          in the minority of cases where a tax crime investigation originates outside the tax
          administration (for example, from an informant‟s report), investigations may be directed
          by a public prosecutor. In Iceland, tax crime investigations are directed and conducted
          within the Directorate of Tax Investigations, which is a separate agency under the
          Ministry of Finance.
               In 11 countries, tax crime investigations are conducted by the police under the
          direction of a public prosecutor or, in the case of Japan, by the public prosecutor directly.
          In Luxembourg, tax crime investigations may be also be directed by an examining judge.
          For these purposes the police include specialist criminal investigations agencies
          established under the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Home Affairs or Ministry of
          Justice, such as France’s Brigade Nationale de Répression de la Délinquance Fiscale. In
          Japan, tax crime investigations are conducted directly by the public prosecutor, and, in
          general, follow administrative tax investigations conducted by the tax administration. In
          Mexico, responsibility for investigations lies with the Attorney-General, who exercises
          this function through the Federal Agency of Investigation and a number of specialist
          units.
               Italy is not included in the four models set out above. In Italy, responsibility for
          carrying out investigations into financial crimes, including tax crimes, sits with the
          Guardia di Finanza, which can conduct such investigations both independently and under
          the direction of the public prosecutor. The Guardia di Finanza is also able to carry out
          civil tax investigations and audits in accordance with its own administrative powers.
B. Customs administration
               Customs administrations are responsible for the assessment and collection of customs
          duties. In many countries they also have responsibility for other taxes and duties,
          including excise duties and indirect taxes, such as sales taxes and VAT. Customs
          administrations hold information about cross-border flows of money and goods, as well
          as details of individual businesses. Customs administrations may be established as
          separate agencies, or as part of a joint tax and customs administration. The table below
          shows which countries have adopted each of these models.

               In 21 countries, the customs administration is a separate agency, typically under the
          Ministry of Finance. In 11 countries the customs administration is part of a single tax and
          customs agency. There is no clear link between the countries and the model adopted. Tax
          and customs have been administered by a single agency in the Netherlands for over
          200 years and in Ireland since the 1920s, whereas in Denmark, Portugal, South Africa
          and the United Kingdom the current joint agency was formed more recently when
          previous separate tax and customs administrations were merged. The combined authority
          in the Slovak Republic was established from 1 January 2012. In contrast, in Canada a
          combined agency was separated into the separate Canada Revenue Agency and Canada
          Border Services Agency in 2003.
               Customs administrations play a key role in preventing and detecting offences related
          to customs and excise duties and other taxes under their responsibility, as well as
          smuggling, drug trafficking, money laundering and offences related to the illicit
          movement of goods and people. In addition to differences in how the customs
          administration is structured as an agency, countries also adopt different models to
          determine the involvement of the customs administration in criminal investigations. The
          table below shows the countries in which the customs administration is responsible for
          criminal investigations, those where the customs administration conducts investigations
          under the direction of a public prosecutor, and those where investigations are conducted
          outside the customs administration. With respect to certain offences, such as smuggling
          and drug trafficking, the customs administration may conduct investigations together with
          other agencies.

           * In Spain, customs investigations are currently directed by an examining judge.
               In 15 countries the customs administration (including joint tax and customs
          administrations) has responsibility for directing and conducting criminal investigations.
          In a further 11 countries, the customs administration conducts criminal investigations
          under the direction of a public prosecutor or (in Spain) an examining judge. In Sweden, a
          few prosecutors are based within the customs administration, to handle relatively
          straightforward cases. This means that in practice the customs administration is able to
          both direct and conduct a small number of simple investigations (as the investigation is
          directed by a prosecutor within the customs administration).
               In seven countries, criminal investigations are conducted outside the customs
          administration. This is in marked contrast to the position with respect to tax crime
          investigations, where investigations were conducted by agencies outside the tax
          administration in 15 countries. In two countries customs investigations are conducted by a
          specialist agency under the Ministry of Finance. In Italy investigations are conducted by
          the Guardia di Finanza. In Greece investigations are conducted by the customs
          administration (Model 1) and by the Economic Crimes Enforcement Agency („SDOE‟)
          (Model 3). In a further five countries, investigations are conducted by the police or
          directly by the public prosecutor. In Mexico, responsibility for investigations lies with the
          Attorney-General, who exercises this function through the Federal Agency of
          Investigation and a number of specialist units. In Japan, customs crime investigations are
          conducted directly by public prosecutors, and in general follow administrative customs
          investigations by the customs administration.
C. Police and other law enforcement agencies
               The police force is typically the primary agency in a country with responsibility to
          enforce criminal law, protect property and prevent civil unrest in civilian matters. A
          detailed analysis into models of policing is beyond the scope of this report. In many
          countries, general policing is the responsibility of local or regional police forces covering
          a defined geographical area.

"227","                                              CHAPTER 2 – ORGANISATIONAL MODELS FOR AGENCIES FIGHTING FINANCIAL CRIME – 25
               A number of countries included in this report have specialist units for combating
          financial offences. These units may be established as separate agencies, such as Greece’s
          SDOE, or within the police or public prosecutor‟s office, such as New Zealand’s
          Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand which is part of the federal
          police. Due to the particular nature of financial offences, some countries have established
          units to deal with particular aspects of police work or types of financial crime. Examples
          of countries which have established these units are set out below.
                Criminal intelligence units have been established in Australia, Austria, Belgium,
                 Canada, Finland, Greece, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden, Turkey, the
                 United States and the United Kingdom.
                Asset recovery units have been established in Austria, Canada, Chile, the Czech
                 Republic, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands,
                 New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the
                 United States.
                Units for combating serious fraud have been established in Austria, Canada, the
                 Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand,
                 South Africa, Turkey and the United Kingdom.
                Units for combating corruption by public officials have been established in Austria,
                 Canada, Chile, Greece, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia,
                 South Africa and Sweden.
               Countries may also establish specialist units for combating financial offences within
          their police other than those listed above. For example, in Luxembourg the police have
          units for combating: organised crime; offences related to financial institutions, insurance,
          the stock exchange and taxation; economic and financial offences; and money laundering.
          In Switzerland, specialised units for dealing with financial crime are established within
          the general police and prosecution authorities. Countries may also have trained and
          experienced specialists in each of the areas listed above, based within the police or other
          law enforcement agencies, but which do not form part of a specialist unit.
D. Financial Intelligence Unit
               Anti-money laundering authorities, including Financial Intelligence Units („FIUs‟),
          are central to national strategies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
          Under anti-money laundering legislation in most countries, businesses such as banks,
          accountants, money transfer companies and certain retailers which accept large cash
          payments are required to submit reports („Suspicious Transaction Reports‟) to the
          national FIU wherever they have a suspicion, or reasonable grounds for a suspicion, that a
          transaction is linked to a money laundering or terrorist financing offence. FIUs analyse
          Suspicious Transaction Reports and should forward information relating to suspected
          predicate offences to the agency with responsibility for investigating the offence. In a
          number of countries, FIUs operate systems for receiving and analysing Suspicious
          Activity Reports, alongside or instead of Suspicious Transaction Reports. For the
          purposes of this report, the term Suspicions Transaction Reports covers both Suspicious
          Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports. In the Netherlands, businesses are
          required to report „unusual transactions‟ to the FIU. The Dutch FIU analyses these
          Unusual Transaction Reports, and determines which should be treated as Suspicious
          Transaction Reports and forwarded to the relevant law enforcement agency.

"228","26 – CHAPTER 2 – ORGANISATIONAL MODELS FOR AGENCIES FIGHTING FINANCIAL CRIME
               Typically, a money laundering offence must be with respect to the proceeds of a
          specified crime, or „predicate offence‟. The list of crimes which constitute predicate
          offences to money laundering varies, but many countries adopt an „all crimes‟ definition.
          Prior to 2012, FATF Recommendations included within the list of predicate offences for
          money laundering certain offences, such as smuggling, which in many countries are
          investigated by the customs administration (or a combined tax and customs
          administration). The 2012 revision of the FATF Recommendations added to this list by
          including the specification of tax crimes. The revised Recommendation should be
          implemented by all countries, in accordance with their domestic law framework.
               Countries have applied different models in deciding where within their financial and
          law enforcement system their national FIU should sit. The table below contains those
          countries that have established the FIU: (i) as a unit of the police or public prosecutor‟s
          office; (ii) as an independent unit within the central bank; (iii) as a separate agency under
          the Ministry of Finance; or (iv) as a separate agency under the Ministry of Justice (or
          equivalent).

               In 16 countries, the FIU is part of the police, or the public prosecutor‟s office
          (Model 1). Of these 16, 15 countries established the FIU within the police, which for
          these purposes includes similar law enforcement agencies, such as the United Kingdom
          Serious Organised Crime Agency. These countries report that this improves the ability of
          the FIU to assist in investigating criminal offences. The police force is often the main
          user of FIU intelligence, and the arrangement ensures ease of access to data, increases the
          speed of response to requests and maximises the benefits of information sharing
          opportunities. This arrangement is therefore especially useful where the role of the FIU is
          seen as directly supporting law enforcement. In a small number of these countries the FIU

          conducts criminal investigations into suspected money laundering, or the location and
          ownership of assets for the purposes of recovering criminal property. In Luxembourg,
          the FIU is established under the authority of the public prosecutor. In the Netherlands
          the FIU has been a division of the police since 2006, but is under the joint authority of the
          police and public prosecutor‟s office.
               In two countries the FIU is established as a division within a financial regulator
          (Model 2). In Korea, the FIU is part of the Financial Services Commission. In Italy, the
          FIU is an independent division within the Bank of Italy. In 13 countries the FIU is
          established as a separate agency under the Ministry of Finance (Model 3). In contrast to
          those established within the police, FIUs established under Models 2 and 3 may have
          easier access to reporting entities, and may participate directly in the regulation and
          supervision of the financial sector, with access to data covered by secrecy provisions for
          use in analyses. FIUs held under the Finance Ministry may also work more closely with
          related Departments, such as the tax administration. According to countries, an
          independent FIU under the Finance Ministry acts as an effective „buffer‟ between
          financial institutions and law enforcement agencies. This has two benefits. Firstly,
          voluntary compliance may be encouraged, as financial institutions might be more
          comfortable providing information to an agency seen as similar to a financial regulator,
          rather than to one which is part of a criminal law enforcement agency. Secondly,
          businesses covered by anti-money laundering legislation are obliged to make Suspicious
          Transaction Reports to the FIU where they have reason to believe a money laundering or
          terrorist financing offence may have occurred. In two countries, the FIU is established
          under the Ministry of Justice or Attorney-General‟s Department (Model 4). In Belgium
          the FIU is held jointly under the Ministries of Finance and Justice and so is a hybrid of
          Models 3 and 4.
E. Prosecution authority
               The prosecution authority is the government agency that represents the State before
          the courts in prosecutions of criminal offences. The table below shows three models in
          which a prosecution office may be structured. Firstly, a central public prosecutor‟s office
          may be responsible for investigating suspected criminal offences and conducting all
          criminal prosecutions. Under this model, the prosecution authority will delegate
          performance of significant parts of an investigation to agencies, such as the police, the tax
          administration or the customs administration (Model 1). Secondly, a central public
          prosecutor‟s office may be responsible for conducting all criminal prosecutions before a
          court, but does not participate in an investigation (Model 2). Finally, agencies responsible
          for investigating offences may have competency to conduct prosecutions directly
          (Model 3).

               The first model has been adopted by 23 countries, which comprise almost all civil law
          countries covered by this report. In these countries criminal investigations are conducted
          by law enforcement agencies under the direction or supervision of a public prosecutor or,
          in some cases, an examining judge. In many of these countries the police are referred to
          as „judicial police‟ when acting as agents of a prosecutor or judicial authority. In some
          countries adopting this model, including Germany, the public prosecutor in practice only
          gets involved at an early stage in investigations of very serious offences. In Mexico,
          responsibility for conducting investigations lies with the Attorney-General, who exercises
          this function through the Federal Agency of Investigation and a number of specialist
          units.
               A further eight countries, including most common law countries, apply Model 2.
          Public prosecutors and judges are not directly involved in criminal investigations, though
          prosecutors may advise other agencies on judicial process and the law of evidence.
          Investigations are conducted by the police, tax administration or other agencies and cases
          are forwarded to a central public prosecution authority for review. A prosecutor may then
          submit the case for prosecution before the court, refer it back to the investigating agency
          with a request for further evidence, or decide not to prosecute.
               The third model is much more uncommon. It is closely related to Model 2, but in
          addition to a central prosecution authority, a number of other law enforcement agencies
          have capacity to conduct criminal prosecutions directly. In the view of New Zealand,
          which is the only country within this report that uses the model, this approach has a

"231","                                              CHAPTER 2 – ORGANISATIONAL MODELS FOR AGENCIES FIGHTING FINANCIAL CRIME – 29
          number of advantages. Each agency has a high degree of specialist skills with respect to
          its area of focus, which enables prosecutions to be conducted by experts in a particular
          area of criminal law. By controlling their own prosecutions, agencies also benefit from
          greater autonomy in decision making and flexibility in setting their strategic direction,
          with less direct competition for the resources of a central public prosecutor. However,
          there is also the potential for the overall duplication of resource as each agency maintains
          its own prosecution structure. There is also the risk of inconsistency in approach between
          agencies, over-specialisation of prosecutors, and the possibility that important cases may
          not be taken based on the priorities of a particular agency that does not consider
          implications for the wider picture.
               The legal systems of four countries listed under Models 1 and 2 in the table above
          include characteristics from Model 3. In Germany, tax administrations in the 16 Länder
          have responsibility for conducting prosecutions of all tax offences while, in Australia,
          the Australian Tax Office has authority to prosecute minor offences. In Sweden, the
          customs administration has a small number of prosecutors who are able to prosecute
          directly cases of a simple nature. Prior to 2005, the United Kingdom tax and customs
          administrations had capacity to conduct criminal prosecutions. When the tax and customs
          administrations were merged in 2005, a combined prosecution agency known as the
          Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office („RCPO‟) was formed. In 2010 the RCPO
          became a unit of the United Kingdom‟s central prosecution service, the Crown
          Prosecution Service. Serious financial crimes may still be prosecuted by the United
          Kingdom‟s Serious Fraud Office. However, these are exceptions. In Germany and
          Sweden the general approach most closely reflects that of Model 1, while the general
          model applied in Australia and the United Kingdom is closest to Model 2.
F. Financial regulators
               Financial regulators, including central banks, are typically responsible for maintaining
          confidence in the financial system, and ensuring the competence of market participants
          and providers of financial services. This encourages stability and efficient functioning in
          the financial sector. Financial regulators may achieve these goals through regulation and
          supervision, together with the investigation of potential legislative or regulatory breaches.
          They may also have direct responsibility to combat crime related to financial markets,
          such as insider trading and market manipulation and in the course of their supervisory and
          regulatory activities collect and hold information on individuals, institutions and
          transactions. In some countries financial regulators also monitor and enforce compliance
          with money laundering regulations by institutions for which they have supervisory
          authority.

                                                      Box 4. Key findings
            In the course of their activities, government agencies collect and hold information on
            individuals, corporations and transactions which may be directly relevant to the activities of
            other agencies.
            Mechanisms to enable information to be shared could improve the prevention and detection of
            financial offences, enable investigations to be conducted more effectively and efficiently, result
            in faster and more successful prosecutions, and increase the likelihood of the proceeds of crime
            being recovered.
            All countries have legal gateways to enable the tax administration to share information obtained
            for the purpose of a civil tax audit or assessment with agencies conducting tax crime
            investigations. There appear to be barriers to the ability of tax administrations to share
            information with the police or public prosecutor in non-tax investigations, with two countries
            imposing an explicit prohibition on the tax administration from providing information relevant to
            non-tax offences. The position is mixed regarding the ability of tax administrations to share tax
            information with the FIU, with four countries expressly prohibiting the FIU from obtaining tax
            information.
            In most countries legal gateways enable the police or public prosecutor to provide information to
            the tax administration for the purpose of administering taxes, though there is often no obligation
            on them to do so. There are appropriate gateways in most countries to enable the police and
            public prosecutor to provide relevant information to agencies conducting tax crime
            investigations. Legal gateways are available in almost all countries to enable the FIU to obtain
            relevant information from the police or public prosecutor, with 1 country imposing a prohibition.
            These gateways broadly reflect the FIU organisational model and there are greater obligations on
            the police to share information with the FIU where the FIU is established as a division of the
            police force.
            The position with respect to the availability to the tax administration of FIU information for the
            purpose of making tax assessments varies significantly: some countries give the tax
            administration direct access or require the FIU to provide relevant information while several
            countries impose an express prohibition on the FIU providing any information. On the other
            hand, legal gateways are in place in most countries to enable FIUs to provide information
            concerning possible tax offences to the agency responsible for investigating tax crimes, though
            in many cases the FIU is able to exercise discretion in deciding whether to provide information.
            All countries provide legal gateways to enable the FIU to provide information concerning
            suspected non-tax offences to the police or public prosecutor. The type of gateway used appears
            to be influenced by the FIU organisational model.

              Financial regulators are generally not obliged to provide information to tax administrations
                 for the purpose of assessing taxes, and a number of countries impose an express prohibition
                 on doing so. Legal gateways exist in most countries to enable financial regulators to provide
                 information concerning suspected tax offences to the agency responsible for investigations.
              All countries have legal gateways for financial regulators to provide information to the
                 police or public prosecutor with respect to suspected non-tax offences or (with the exception
                 of one country) to the FIU with respect to suspected money laundering or terrorist financing
                 activity, though in some cases this information may only be shared on request.
              With respect to the sharing of information between agencies, the following successful
                 practices have been identified.
                 - Co-ordinated response to Suspicious Transaction Reports by the tax administration and
                     FIU (Ireland).
                 - Access to Suspicious Transaction Reports for the tax administration (Australia).
                 - Access to tax information for the FIU and co-operation between the FIU and financial
                     regulators (Italy).
                 - Use of covenants to improve co-operation between the tax administration and police (the
                     Netherlands).
                 - An integrated approach to combating tax crimes between the tax administration and
                     police, through the Brigade Nationale d’Enquêtes Économiques („BNEE‟) and the
                     Brigade Nationale de Répression de la Délinquance Fiscale („BNRDF‟) (France).
A. In general
               In the course of their normal activities, government agencies gather and hold
          information with respect to individuals, companies and transactions. This may include
          information that would be valuable to other agencies for the purposes of analysis,
          identifying possible breaches of law or regulations, or in ongoing criminal investigations.
          The ability to share this information can provide a valuable source of intelligence to
          agencies responsible for combating financial crimes.
               Effective information sharing can be used to identify evidence which may lead to new
          investigations, and to support ongoing investigations. In some cases information may be
          of a type that the receiving agency could not obtain directly, particularly where the
          information is of a specialist nature such as that held by the tax administration or FIU. In
          others, the ability to receive information from other agencies may reduce the duplication
          of work by different agencies, increasing the speed and reducing the cost of
          investigations. Sharing of information can be used to identify new angles to existing
          investigations, such as where an investigation into a tax offence reveals other criminal
          activity and money laundering. The use of information from different sources may
          increase officers‟ understanding of an issue or of the activities of a suspect, possibly
          increasing the effectiveness of enquiries. Importantly, mechanisms for sharing
          information may be used to develop relationships between agencies, and key individuals
          in those agencies, which can be beneficial in developing new and enhanced forms of
          inter-agency co-operation.

               Legal gateways for sharing information may take a number of forms. Primary
          legislation often provides the basic framework for co-operation, for example by requiring
          that an agency shares certain types of information in specified circumstances, or by
          placing restrictions on the ability of agencies to share information. Within the framework
          of what is permitted by law, agencies may enter into bilateral agreements or „memoranda
          of understanding‟, agreeing to share information where this is of relevance to the other
          agency‟s activities. These memoranda typically contain details of the types of information
          that will be shared, the circumstances in which sharing will take place and any restrictions
          on sharing information such as that the information may only be used for specified
          purposes. Memoranda may also include other terms agreed by the agencies, such as a
          requirement for the agency receiving information to provide feedback on the results of
          investigations in which the information was used. Memoranda of understanding may be
          of use in agreeing practical arrangements for co-operation, such as the format of any
          request for information, details of competent officials authorised to deal with requests,
          and agreed notice periods and time limits.
B. Arrangements for sharing information through legal gateways
               Arrangements for sharing information through legal gateways fall within four broad
          categories: (i) direct access to records and databases; (ii) mandatory spontaneous sharing
          of information; (iii) spontaneous sharing of information; and (iv) sharing of information
          on request. Under each of these four types of legal gateways for sharing information
          among different agencies it is important to protect the confidentiality of information and
          the integrity of work carried out by other agencies. For example, in Sweden, information
          shared between agencies through legal gateways must at all times comply with the
          provisions of the Secrecy Act. Other countries have similar protections.
          (i) Direct access to records and databases
               An agency may grant direct access to its records and information stored on its
          databases to designated individuals within other authorities. This access may be for a
          wide range of purposes, or restricted to specific cases or circumstances. This has
          advantages in that an agency requiring information is able to search for the information
          directly and in many cases obtain it in a timely manner. However, databases may contain
          large quantities of data arranged for the purposes of the agency holding the information,
          and not those of the agency seeking information. This may make identifying important
          information difficult for officials unfamiliar with the other agency‟s systems. There may
          be cases where officials conducting an investigation are unaware of information
          contained on a database, which goes unused even though access is available. Compared to
          other mechanisms for sharing information, allowing direct access to records carries a
          particular risk that data may be accessed for purposes other than those for which it was
          originally intended. Countries may therefore seek to introduce safeguards to protect the
          confidentiality of sensitive information, such as restricting access to databases to a small
          number of nominated individuals, and maintaining records of what information was
          accessed and for what purpose.
          (ii) Mandatory spontaneous sharing of information
               An agency may be required to provide certain categories of information
          spontaneously, without requiring a request to be made. This is sometimes referred to as a
          „reporting obligation‟. This has the advantage that the information to be shared is
EFFECTIVE INTER-AGENCY CO–OPERATION IN FIGHTING TAX CRIMES AND OTHER FINANCIAL CRIMES – © OECD 2012
"
"236","34 – CHAPTER 3 - MODELS FOR SHARING INFORMATION
          identified by officials within the agency holding it, who are likely to have a greater
          understanding of the information in their records. However, in order for this to be
          effective an agency must have clear rules and mechanisms in place to identify the
          information that must be shared. This may be straightforward where an obligation exists
          to provide all information of a certain class (for example, copies of all Cash Declaration
          Forms), but is more complex where judgement must be exercised to identify information
          that would be relevant to an investigation. Further, by itself this method does not allow
          officials conducting an investigation to specify the information required. However, it may
          facilitate the detection of previously unknown criminal activity.
          (iii) Spontaneous sharing of information
               An agency may have the ability to provide certain categories of information
          spontaneously, but is able to exercise its discretion in deciding whether or not to do so.
          Where this operates well, it can be at least as effective as the previous method.
          Information is shared spontaneously, but officials in the agency holding the information
          are able to exercise their judgement to provide only that information which is of value
          and not all information of a particular class. This model is particularly effective when it is
          supported by close co-operative working arrangements and a good understanding by
          officials in each agency of the information requirements of the other agency. This means
          that, even in the absence of a specific obligation, information sharing between can be
          very effective.
               Models for information sharing that allow discretion to be exercised require clear
          rules for how this is to be done. For example, decisions as to whether or not relevant
          information is to be shared may be limited to individuals in certain positions or levels of
          management, while guidelines may set out the factors which can be taken into account in
          making a decision. The effectiveness of this type of legal gateway is also dependent on
          the ability of officials to identify relevant information and their willingness to exercise
          discretion to provide information. Where there is no previous experience of inter-agency
          co-operation, the benefits to both agencies of sharing information must be made clear or
          there may be a danger that officials exercise their discretion and choose not to share
          valuable intelligence.
          (iv) Sharing information on request
               An agency may provide information only when specifically requested. This may be
          seen as the simplest of the four methods for sharing information, as there is less need for
          rules or mechanisms to identify information for sharing or provide access to records. It
          also has the advantage of allowing officials to specify precisely the information they
          require. In the context of an ongoing transaction where investigators have identified
          specific information that is required, this can be a valuable mechanism. However, in
          many cases an agency may hold information that an investigator is not aware of. This
          may mean that the investigator is unable to request information, or is only able to do so at
          a later stage when the value of the information may be reduced.
C. Analysis of the existing gateways
               Each of these arrangements has advantages and disadvantages, which will vary
          depending upon the agencies involved, the type of information concerned and the
          circumstances in which the information is required, and most countries employ a

          combination of arrangements. For example, an FIU may be required to provide
          information concerning possible offences to the police force spontaneously, and also to
          provide additional information on request.
                The following paragraphs include details of legal gateways permitting the sharing of
          information between agencies that are of particular importance in combating tax crimes
          and other financial crime. Countries were invited to provide information on their current
          gateways which allow for information to be shared in particular circumstances. Countries
          analysed each gateway and placed them in categories 0 to 4, where: 4 means the agency
          holding information grants direct access to its records or databases; 3 means the agency
          holding information is obliged to provide information spontaneously; 2 means the agency
          holding information is able, but not obliged, to provide information spontaneously;
          1 means the agency holding information has an obligation or ability to share information
          only on request; and 0 means the agency holding information is unable to share
          information, either because no legal gateway exists or because of a specific restriction.
                The analysis is not meant to be an evaluation of the effectiveness of the gateways in
          place in a given country, but simply represents an overview of the legal gateways that are
          in place. In addition, they do not necessarily indicate that in all cases a legal gateway in
          one category is in practice more effective than one in another category. For example,
          spontaneous sharing of information may be very effective when there is a long-standing
          co-operative relationship between the agencies involved, and there is a clear
          understanding of what information may be useful in the activities of the recipient agency.
          On the other hand, direct access to information may be less effective in cases where
          officials are unfamiliar with the information available or have not received appropriate
          training in using systems operated by the other agency.
                This information is set out in tables below, together with comments on particular
          practices. These tables indicate the broad position in countries. They cannot fully take
          into account the complexity of the different types of information that can be shared, and
          the circumstances surrounding when information can be made available. Importantly,
          they also indicate only the existence of legal gateways and mechanisms for information to
          be shared, and not the practical experience of how these are used.

               The model a country adopts for countering tax crimes determines the role of the tax
          administration in combating tax crime (see Chapter 2). This directly influences the
          practical mechanisms for sharing information held by the tax administration for the
          purposes of assessing taxes with tax crime investigators. The table below shows the
          availability to agencies investigating tax offences of information held by the tax
          administration.

               In all countries covered by the report, gateways exist for the tax administration to
          provide tax crime investigators, as defined in Chapter 2, with information relevant to
          suspected tax offences. In 21 countries, tax crime investigators have direct access to
          information obtained by the tax administration for the purposes of administering and
          assessing taxes. In Australia, where tax offences are under investigation by officials
          within the tax administration, these investigators have direct access to information held
          by the tax administration for other purposes. Where a tax offence is being investigated by
          another agency, such as the Australian Federal Police, or State Police, the tax
          administration does not grant direct access to tax information, but may share relevant
          information with investigators. In Canada, tax crime investigators within the Canada
          Revenue Agency have direct access to information held by the tax administration. The
          Canadian tax administration also has the ability to share information with provincial tax
          administrations, under Memoranda of Understanding. In seven countries, the tax
          administration has an obligation to provide this information to tax crime investigators, but
          investigators cannot access it directly. In the Czech Republic, the tax administration
          must report suspected offences and spontaneously provide any information relevant to an
          offence it has reported. However, where a tax criminal investigation did not commence
          following the report of a suspicion by the tax administration, the Czech Republic tax
          administration may only provide information requested by the public prosecutor or judge.
          In three countries the tax administration is able to provide tax information to tax crime
          investigators, but is not under an obligation and may exercise discretion in choosing
          whether to do so.
               In Mexico, where the tax administration has grounds to suspect a tax offence has been
          committed, it is required to report this to the public prosecutor. However, officials
          conducting tax crime investigations in Mexico may only obtain information from the tax

"240","38 – CHAPTER 3 - MODELS FOR SHARING INFORMATION
          administration on request, even where the investigation was commenced following a
          report by the tax administration. In most countries, tax crime investigators may request
          information from the tax administrator in addition to that provided through other legal
          gateways. No country imposes a prohibition on the tax administration from sharing
          information relevant to suspected tax offences with tax crime investigators.
                          Box 5. Matching Gateways with Models to Tackle Tax Crime
            The report identifies four models for investigating and prosecuting tax crime and it may be
            interesting to match these models with the gateways identified above. Italy is not included in
            these four models. In Italy, the Guardia di Finanza, which has responsibility for carrying out
            investigations into tax crimes, has direct access to the Anagrafe Tributaria (the „Tax Register‟)
            held by the Italian Revenue Agency, which includes tax information on Italian residents. Greece
            operates a hybrid model whereby tax crime investigations can be conducted by the tax
            administration or by SDOE, a separate agency under the Ministry of Finance.
            Models where tax crime investigations are conducted within the tax administration
            In Models 1 and 2 described in Chapter 2, tax crime investigations are conducted by officials
            within the tax administration. Under Model 1 investigations are both directed and conducted by
            the tax administration, while under Model 2 they are conducted by the tax administration under
            the direction of a public prosecutor or examining judge. In countries applying these models,
            physical or legal barriers may exist to restrict access by criminal investigators to information
            gathered by the tax administration in the course of its tax audit and compliance activities. Of the
            18 countries that apply Model 1 or 2 in conducting tax crime investigations, 17 countries
            (Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Korea, the Netherlands,
            New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the
            United States) allow information obtained by the tax administration for the purposes of
            conducting tax audits and assessments to be used by its tax crime investigators. Much of this
            information may be obtained directly from taxpayer records and databases, while other
            information may be requested from the relevant area. It is important to note that although
            criminal investigators have direct access to information held by tax auditors within the same tax
            administration, they may not use tax audit powers to obtain information solely for the purposes
            of a criminal investigation. In Sweden, tax criminal investigations are carried out by Tax Fraud
            Investigation Units („TFIU‟), which are part of the tax administration, but are treated separately
            for the purpose of legislation governing the sharing of information. TFIU may access directly
            certain information held by other parts of the tax administration. Other information may be
            provided spontaneously by the Swedish tax administration or made available on request. In
            Chile, the tax administration has created an electronic platform accessed through a secure
            website, to which the public prosecutor‟s office has direct access. This provides instant access to
            tax information such as tax returns, while other information may be obtained from tax auditors
            on request. In 1 country (Switzerland) officials within the tax administration responsible for
            administering and assessing taxes are required to share with the agency‟s criminal investigators
            any information that is required for the purposes of investigating a tax offence.
            Models where tax crime investigations are conducted outside of the tax administration
            In countries where tax crime investigations are conducted outside the tax administration
            (Models 3 and 4), legal gateways are generally in place to ensure that criminal investigators have
            access to relevant information held by the tax administration, which may include taxpayer data,
            so as to enable a full and effective investigation to take place. Under Model 3, investigations are
            conducted by agencies outside the tax administration but under the supervision of the Ministry of
            Finance.

                      Box 5. Matching Gateways with Models to Tackle Tax Crime (cont.)
            In all three countries where this model is applied (Greece, Iceland and Turkey), tax crime
            investigators are granted direct access to some or all relevant information held by the tax
            administration. Under Model 4, tax crime investigations are conducted by the police or directly
            by the public prosecutor. Of the 11 countries applying this model, only 1 country (Belgium)
            provides for tax crime investigators to have direct access to tax administration information. In
            six countries (the Czech Republic, Denmark, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway and Slovenia) the tax
            administration must provide the police or public prosecutor with relevant tax information
            spontaneously, without the ability to exercise discretion. In three countries (Finland, France and
            the Slovak Republic) the tax administration has the ability to provide information spontaneously
            to police conducting tax investigations, but is not under an obligation to do so. France does allow
            direct access to taxpayer information for tax inspectors working in the Brigade Nationale
            d‟Enquetes Economiques („BNEE‟) that operates within the judicial police. In 1 country
            (Mexico), the tax administration may report tax offences to the police responsible for conducting
            tax investigations, but can only provide additional tax information on request.
     (ii) Availability to the police or public prosecutor investigating non-tax offences
                In the course of their normal activities, tax administrations hold significant
          information about taxpayers, including personal and bank details, information concerning
          business activities, and data on people, capital and goods moving across national borders.
          As a result, tax administrations sometimes find themselves with information that leads its
          officials to suspect a non-tax offence may have occurred, as well as other details that may
          be valuable to police conducting criminal investigations. The table below shows the
          availability of information held by the tax administration to the police or public

"242","40 – CHAPTER 3 - MODELS FOR SHARING INFORMATION
               In 12 countries, where the tax administration obtains information relevant to a non-tax
          investigation, it is under an obligation to report this to the police or public prosecutor. In
          Italy, if the Italian Revenue Agency or Guardia di Finanza obtains information relevant
          to a non-tax investigation, it is obliged to report this information to the public prosecutor.
          In Switzerland, federal officials have an obligation to inform the public prosecutor with
          respect to any suspicions of possible non-tax offences which may be punishable by a
          prison sentence, which includes all serious offences.
               In 12 countries, the tax administration is able to provide the police or public
          prosecutor with information it obtains that relates to suspected non-tax offences, but it is
          not under an obligation to do so. However, in a number of countries this ability is subject
          to important restrictions, examples of which include Australia, Portugal, Canada and the
          United States. The Australian tax administration is able to provide information
          spontaneously to law enforcement agencies, but only for the purposes of investigating
          serious offences punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding 12 months, or in
          connection with the making of proceeds of crime orders. The police cannot obtain any
          taxpayer information relevant to less serious offences. The Portuguese tax administration
          may provide the public prosecutor with certain information relevant to criminal
          investigations spontaneously, and is also obliged to provide information on request where
          a prosecutor has determined that tax secrecy provisions should be lifted. Information may
          be shared between the Portuguese police and tax administration via a liaison group within
          the Financial Intelligence Unit, which is part of the police force. In Canada the police
          may obtain taxpayer information from the tax administration where the information is
          required for a case related to recovery of proceeds of crime, or the agencies are working
          together in joint forces operations. The Canadian tax administration may also provide
          information to police and law enforcement agencies where a court order has been
          obtained, criminal charges are laid or it has concerns related to threats against Canada‟s
          security. In the United States the tax administration may share information with law
          enforcement agencies that are conducting a joint investigation with the IRS Criminal
          Investigations and the investigation has been approved by the Department of Justice Tax
          Division. Otherwise, the tax administration may only provide taxpayer information on
          request under an ex parte order that has been signed by a federal judge.
               In five countries, the tax administration may not provide any information
          spontaneously to the police or public prosecutor, but may provide information on request.
          In South Africa, the police can generally only obtain information relevant to non-tax
          investigations from the tax administration on request, under specific legislation related to
          the prevention and investigation of serious organised crime. Information requests under
          this legislation must be specific. The South African tax administration may also inform
          the police where it discovers evidence of a possible non-tax offence, but only if it first
          obtains specific consent from the court. In the Czech Republic the tax administration
          cannot provide information directly to the police, but may provide information requested
          by the public prosecutor.
               In two countries there is a general prohibition against the tax administration providing
          information to the police or public prosecutor with respect to non-tax offences.
          New Zealand legislation specifically prohibits the tax administration from providing
          taxpayer information to the police or other agencies except in cases related to the
          administration of taxation, investigation of tax crimes and the facilitation of asset
          recovery. Therefore, with the exception of asset recovery cases, the tax administration
          cannot share tax information with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of

          investigating non-tax offences. In Germany, disclosure by the tax administration of
          information protected by tax secrecy rules is only permitted in very exceptional
          circumstances.
                In eight countries (the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, the Slovak Republic,
          Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Turkey) there is no obligation on the tax administration to
          share information spontaneously with the police or public prosecutor, but the tax
          administration must nevertheless alert the police or public prosecutor where they have
          reason to suspect a non-tax offence has taken place. In Sweden, this obligation only
          applies to suspicions with respect to specific offences, which are mainly those which are
          connected with tax crimes, such as accounting offences and bribery.
     (iii) Availability to the Financial Intelligence Unit
                Tax administrations in many countries routinely receive financial information from
          taxpayers and financial institutions, including details of asset ownership, bank accounts,
          income and expenditure, cross-border movements of people and capital and relationships
          between individuals and corporations. This information may be extremely useful to FIUs
          in analysing Suspicious Transaction Reports and other data for the purposes of
          identifying possible money laundering and terrorist financing. The table below shows the
          availability of information held by the tax administration to the FIU.

                From the table it can be seen that there is a broad spread of positions between
          countries as to the ability of the FIU to gain access to tax information. In four countries,
          the FIU is granted direct access to databases maintained by the tax administration. In the
          Czech Republic, the FIU has direct access to the ADIS database, which contains
          taxpayer information including the location of business premises, bank account number,
          tax arrears, any risk assessment and relations to other natural and legal persons. In Italy,
          the Guardia di Finanza, the FIU and the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia (the Bureau of
          Anti-Mafia Investigation) are the lead agencies in combating money laundering. The
          Italian FIU has direct access to the Anagrafe dei Conti („Account and Deposit Register‟)
          maintained by the tax administration, which includes information on accounts and

"244","42 – CHAPTER 3 - MODELS FOR SHARING INFORMATION
          financial transactions carried out by financial intermediaries, including banks,
          post-offices, trust companies and brokerage companies. Legislation has also been passed
          which allows the Italian FIU direct access to the Anagrafe Tributaria („Tax Register‟),
          containing information on the tax information of Italian taxpayers, such as declared
          income, tax payments, real estate and other property, cross-border financial transactions,
          and information on the results of tax audits. Direct access for the Italian FIU to the
          Anagrafe Tributaria has not yet been implemented.
               In 13 countries the tax administration has a reporting obligation to provide
          information concerning possible money laundering or terrorist financing to the FIU. In
          another seven countries the tax administration has the ability to provide such information,
          but is able to exercise its discretion in doing so. These include Ireland, where legislation
          requires financial institutions and other reporting entities to submit Suspicious
          Transaction Reports to both the tax administration and the FIU, and broad legal gateways
          permit the agencies to share information. Specialists from the FIU and the tax
          administration‟s Suspicious Transaction Reports Office meet approximately every four to
          six weeks to discuss their analyses of Suspicious Transaction Reports and to co-ordinate
          investigations where evidence exists of both tax and non-tax offences, as well as discuss
          broader operational issues related to money laundering investigations. Arrangements are
          also in place for the tax administration to provide the FIU with information relating to
          declarations of cash moving into or out of the EU through Ireland. In Chile, the tax
          administration may only share tax information with the FIU where consent has been
          obtained from a judge.
               In four countries tax information is only made available to the FIU on request. In
          Sweden and Switzerland, to obtain information from the tax administration the FIU must
          also demonstrate the specific facts and circumstances which may be confirmed by the
          information requested.
               Legislation in four countries specifically prevents the tax administration from sharing
          information with the FIU, even where the information would be directly relevant to the
          FIU‟s activities. In Japan and the United States, tax offences are not currently included
          in the definition of a predicate offence for money laundering purposes. In contrast, tax
          crimes are predicate offences for money laundering purposes in Australia and
          New Zealand. In Australia, this is because AUSTRAC is established as a regulatory
          agency and not an investigatory body. In New Zealand, this legislation is currently under
          review to determine whether the tax administration‟s powers to share information with
          other agencies may be widened.
E. Information held by the police or public prosecutor
     (i)     Availability to the tax administration for the purpose of administering taxes
               Investigations by the police into financial crimes may include a detailed analysis of a
          suspect‟s financial position. This may lead to the discovery of information that would be
          of interest to the tax administration for the purposes of administering taxes and
          determining tax assessments. The table below shows the ability of the police or public
          prosecutor to share this information with the tax administration. Legal gateways with
          respect to information relevant to tax crime investigations are considered separately.

           access to information‟) and the Italian Revenue Agency (under „Obligation to share information
           spontaneously’).
                In Italy, the Guardia di Finanza has authority to carry out civil tax investigations and
          audits under its administrative powers. In particular, the Guardia di Finanza may conduct
          civil tax audits that follow on from a criminal tax investigation (subject to authorisation
          by the public prosecutor). The Guardia di Finanza has direct access to information held
          by other police agencies for the purpose of tax audits and administration of taxes.
          Although operating under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, the Guardia di
          Finanza has broad powers to investigate financial crimes, including money laundering,
          smuggling, drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Under Italian law, any agency or
          public official who discovers information relating to possible tax evasion is obliged to
          share this information with the Guardia di Finanza, which may conduct an investigation.
                In ten countries a mandatory gateway exists which requires the police or public
          prosecutor to share information with the tax administration for the purpose of determining
          tax assessments. In Switzerland the police must provide federal and cantonal tax
          administrations with any information they obtain that may be useful in the administration
          and assessment of taxes. In 17 countries, the police or public prosecutor may
          spontaneously provide information to the tax administration, but may exercise discretion
          in doing so. In Portugal, the public prosecutor is able to share information with the tax
          administration for the purposes of administering taxes and determining tax assessments.
          This normally happens at the end of a criminal investigation. In four countries the police
          or public prosecutor are not able to provide information spontaneously, but the tax
          administration may request details relevant to the administration of taxes. In one country
          (Mexico) a prohibition applies to prevent the police or the public prosecutor from sharing
          information with the tax administration for the purpose of assessing taxes.

     (ii) Availability to agencies investigating tax offences
                Tax crimes often do not occur in isolation, but are connected to other offences. Police
          and public prosecutors investigating non-tax offences may obtain information that
          indicates a tax crime may have occurred, or is relevant to an ongoing tax investigation.
          This can prove a valuable source of intelligence for officials responsible for investigating
          suspected tax crimes. The table below shows the ability of the agency responsible for
          investigating tax crimes in each country to obtain information from the police or public
          prosecutor.

                In all countries, legal gateways exist to enable police or prosecutors to provide
          information to officials conducting tax crime investigations, or for these officials to
          access relevant information directly. This means that, on average, obligations to share
          information relevant to tax crimes is greater than the obligation to share information
          relevant to non-tax crime. To an extent this may be a result of the fact that in ten countries
          tax offences are investigated by the police or public prosecutor. Another reason could be
          the status accorded to tax crimes, as offences against the State.
                In nine countries, officials conducting tax crime investigations have direct access to
          information held by the police or public prosecutor. In 12 countries, the police or public
          prosecutor has an obligation to provide tax crime investigators spontaneously with
          information relevant to a suspected tax offence. In ten countries, where the police or
          public prosecutor obtains information relating to a possible tax offence it may share this
          spontaneously with tax crime investigators, but is not under an obligation to do so. In the
          Slovak Republic, police officials conducting tax crime investigations may only obtain
          information held by the police relating to other cases on request. In a number of countries
          tax crime investigators can request information in addition to that available through other
          gateways. No country prohibits the police or public prosecutor from sharing information
          relevant to a tax offence with tax crime investigators.

                        Box 6. Matching Gateways with Models to Tackle Tax Crime
          The report identifies four models for investigating and prosecuting tax crime and it may be
          interesting to match these models with the gateways identified above. Italy is not included in
          these four models. In Italy, the Guardia di Finanza, which has responsibility for carrying out
          investigations into tax crimes, has direct access to information held by other police agencies. In
          addition, where the police or public prosecutors, in the course of their duties, obtain information
          concerning possible tax evasion, they are obliged to share this information spontaneously with
          the Guardia di Finanza. Greece applies a hybrid model, whereby tax investigations can be
          conducted by the tax administration or by SDOE, a separate agency under the Ministry of
          Finance.
          Models where tax crime investigations are conducted within the tax administration
          18 countries were identified as applying Models 1 or 2 for investigating tax offences, which
          means that tax crime investigations are conducted by officials within the tax administration. Of
          these, the United States is the only country to allow direct access to police information for tax
          investigators. In the United States, IRS criminal investigators have direct access to all criminal
          history information held by law enforcement agencies, through the National Crime Information
          System. Where further information is required, tax crime investigators can request it from the
          originating law enforcement agency. Through various task forces and teams, investigators can
          also obtain trends and typologies from other law enforcement agencies upon request.
          In ten countries (Chile, Germany, Greece, India, Korea, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa,
          Spain and Switzerland), the police or public prosecutor are obliged to share information relevant
          to a suspected tax offence. Where the Portuguese tax administration is conducting a criminal
          investigation into a tax offence, the official co-ordinating the investigation may also ask the FIU,
          which is part of the police force, to grant the tax administration real-time access to the police
          Integrated System for Criminal Investigation, which includes information held by the criminal
          police. In Spain, examining judges are obliged to share with tax crime investigators information
          relevant to suspected offences. Spanish police, on the other hand, may only provide information
          to tax crime investigators on request. In Korea, the public prosecutor must provide the National
          Tax Service spontaneously with information relevant to a tax crime investigation, whereas the
          Korean police may only provide information on request.
          In a further seven countries applying Models 1 or 2 (Australia, Austria, Canada, Ireland, New
          Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom), information relating to a tax crime investigation
          may be provided spontaneously by the police or public prosecutor, but there is no obligation on
          the police to do so. In Sweden the general position is that the police are able to share to share
          information spontaneously with tax crime investigators. However, tax crime investigators also
          have direct access to police registers which contain details of suspects and criminal records.
          Models where tax crime investigations are conducted outside of the tax administration
          Of the three countries applying Model 3 (whereby investigations are conducted by agencies
          outside the tax administration but under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance), no country
          provides for tax crime investigators to have direct access to information held by the police or
          public prosecutor. In two countries (Greece and Iceland) where the police obtain information
          relevant to a tax crime investigation, it has obligation to provide this information spontaneously
          to the agency conducting the investigation. In one country (Turkey), the police are able to
          provide tax crime investigators with information relevant to an investigation, but may exercise
          discretion.

"248","46 – CHAPTER 3 - MODELS FOR SHARING INFORMATION
                     Box 6. Matching Gateways with Models to Tackle Tax Crime (cont.)
          Model 4 for investigating tax crime investigations is applied in 11 countries, and investigations
          are conducted by the police or directly by the public prosecutor. In seven countries where tax
          crimes are investigated by the general police force (the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,
          Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway and Slovenia) officers investigating tax crimes have direct access
          to police records and databases. In Japan, prosecutors investigating tax crimes have direct access
          to information within the public prosecutor‟s office. In France, tax offences may be conducted
          by a number of police forces acting as judicial police under the direction of a prosecutor.
          However, a number of forces are more specialised in financial investigations and in 2010 the
          Brigade National de Répression de la Délinquance Fiscale („BNRDF‟) was established as an
          agency with specific police and tax skills to combat serious tax offences. French police forces do
          not generally grant direct access to information for offices in other police forces. However, they
          are able to share information spontaneously where this is relevant to an offence under
          investigation by another force. In Belgium, the police are able to provide information
          spontaneously to tax crime investigators, but are not obliged to do so. In the Slovak Republic,
          officers investigating tax crimes can only obtained information held by the police relating to
          other cases on request.
     (iii) Availability to the Financial Intelligence Unit
               FIU are responsible for conducting analyses of possible money laundering and terrorist
          financing, which may be used by law enforcement agencies in combating crime. These
          analyses may themselves be informed by information obtained by the FIU from the police or
          prosecutors, either where any agency has obtained evidence of a possible predicate offence, or
          where it holds other information relevant to the FIU‟s work. The table below shows the
          availability to FIU of information held by the police or public prosecutor.

               In all countries but one, legal gateways exist to enable the FIU to obtain information
          from the police for the purpose of their activities, but the mechanisms used vary widely.
          In 11 countries, the FIU has direct access to information held by the police or public
          prosecutor relevant to its activities. In Greece, the FIU has direct access to police
          information. The Greek public prosecutor is under an obligation to provide the FIU with
          information spontaneously, but does not give the FIU direct access to information. Where
          the police obtain information concerning possible money laundering or terrorist
          financing, in nine countries they are obligated to provide this information spontaneously
          to the FIU. In a further six countries, the police are able to provide this information

"249","                                                                                CHAPTER 3 - MODELS FOR SHARING INFORMATION – 47
          spontaneously, but are not under an obligation to do so. In Turkey, although the police
          may exercise discretion in providing information spontaneously to the FIU, the Public
          Prosecutor‟s Office must inform the FIU about results of court decisions related to money
          laundering and terrorist financing offences. In Belgium, since 16 April 2012 the Central
          Seizure and Confiscation Office (OCSC), which is part of the public prosecutor‟s office,
          and the FIU can share information concerning the proceeds of crime. In five countries,
          the FIU does not have access to police data and the police cannot provide information
          spontaneously, but the FIU can request information for the purposes of its analyses and
          other activities. One country has a blanket prohibition on the police sharing information
          with the FIU.
                             Box 7. Matching Gateways with FIU Organisational Models
          The report identifies four organisational models for FIUs and it appears that the ability of an FIU
          to access police information, as set out in the table above, reflects the Model used for
          establishing the FIU, though exceptions do exist.
          FIU established as a division of the police or public prosecutor’s office
          Of the countries covered by this report, 16 applied Model 1 in setting up their FIU. Of these
          countries, nine (Austria, Finland, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
          Sweden and Switzerland) provide for the FIU to have direct access to relevant information held
          by the police. In Luxembourg the FIU is a division of the public prosecutor‟s office. The
          Luxembourg FIU has direct access to information held by the public prosecutor, which will
          include information provided to the public prosecutor by the police. The FIU may also request
          additional specific information from the police.
          In a further seven countries (Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Norway, the Slovak Republic and the
          United Kingdom) the police are required to provide officers in the FIU (which in these countries
          is within the police or similar agency) with any information it obtains relevant to the FIU‟s
          activities. In one country (New Zealand) the police are able to provide relevant information
          spontaneously to the FIU, but are not required to do so. That the police in a significant majority
          of countries adopting this model permit the FIU direct access to information, or are obligated to
          share information spontaneously, may reflect the fact that in these countries the FIU is seen as
          having a direct role in law enforcement.
          FIU established as an independent unit within the central bank, or as a separate agency
          under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance or Ministry of Justice
          Under Models 2 to 4, the FIU is established as an independent unit within a financial regulator,
          or as a separate agency under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance or Ministry of Justice. A
          total of 16 countries apply one of these 3 models (Belgium applying a hybrid of Models 3 and
          4). Of these 16, two countries (Greece and Slovenia) provide for the FIU to have direct access to
          relevant information held by the police. In Slovenia, this is under an agreement on mutual co
          operation signed by the Slovenian police and the FIU, which sits under the Ministry of Finance.
          Under this agreement the Slovenian FIU has direct access to specific police records for the
          purposes of the FIU‟s activities in preventing and detecting money laundering and terrorist
          financing. The police must also inform the FIU about the results of any criminal investigation
          that commenced as a result of a referral. In three countries (Italy, South Africa and Spain), the
          police have a reporting obligation to provide relevant information spontaneously to the FIU. In
          five countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, France and Turkey), the police may exercise
          discretion in providing information spontaneously to the FIU. In five countries (the Czech
          Republic, India, Korea, Mexico and the United States) the FIU may only obtain police
          information on request. In one country (Chile) a prohibition applies to prevent the police and
          public prosecutor from sharing information with the FIU.

"250","48 – CHAPTER 3 - MODELS FOR SHARING INFORMATION
F. Information held by the Financial Intelligence Unit
     (i)     Availability to the tax administration for the purpose of administering taxes
               Under anti-money laundering legislation, designated businesses are required to
          submit Suspicious Transaction Reports to their country‟s FIU where they suspect or have
          reasonable grounds to suspect possible money laundering or terrorist financing. FIUs also
          conduct analyses of information obtained from Suspicious Transaction Reports and other
          agencies. Much of the FIU‟s work concerns the identification and analysis of assets,
          capital flows and financial transactions. FIUs may therefore hold significant information
          which may be relevant to a country‟s tax administration for the purpose of determining
          tax assessments. This is not related to whether tax crimes are included as predicate
          offences in a country.
               The table below shows the availability of FIU information to the tax administrations
          for the purpose of administering and assessing taxes. Information for the purposes of tax
          crime investigations is considered separately.

               Tax administrations in four countries have direct access to information held by the
          FIU. In Australia, the tax administration has a right of access to all FIU information,
          including direct access to all Suspicious Transaction Reports, via a secure online
          connection for any purpose relating to the facilitation of the administration or
          enforcement of tax law. There are however restrictions on the use of FIU information by
          the Australian Tax Office. For example, Suspicious Transaction Reports may be used by
          the tax administration for intelligence, but cannot be used or relied on for evidentiary
          purposes. The Australian FIU also provides the tax administration with complete data sets
          of STR information, which the tax administration uses in its automated data matching and
          data mining programmes. In the United States, the tax administration also has direct and
          immediate access to FIU databases for the enforcement of both civil and criminal
          compliance. The United Kingdom tax administration has direct access to Suspicious

          criminal investigations divisions. Information obtained from the FIU can be used in
          determining civil tax assessments, but Suspicious Transaction Reports cannot be shared
          with unauthorised staff unless the reports are first sanitised to protect the source of
          information. In Ireland, legislation provides for the Revenue to receive copies of all
          Suspicious Transaction Reports directly from regulated businesses. This means that the
          Irish tax administration directly and independently receives information that in most
          countries must be obtained from the FIU. Further information may be provided by the
          Irish FIU spontaneously or on request.
               In six countries, the FIU has an obligation to provide the tax administration with
          information relevant to determining tax assessments.
               In a further 11 countries, the FIU is able to share information spontaneously with the
          tax administration, but is not obliged to. In the Slovak Republic, the FIU may inform the
          tax administration of any information that the FIU believes may result in new civil tax
          proceedings, or would be relevant to ongoing civil tax proceedings. However, this
          obligation does not apply where informing the tax administration could endanger the
          success of the FIU‟s activities.
               In three countries, the tax administration is only able to obtain information relevant to
          tax assessments from the FIU on request.
               Importantly, in eight countries the FIU is prohibited from sharing information with
          the tax administration for tax assessment purposes. In Italy, although the FIU cannot
          provide information directly to the Italian Revenue Agency, it does provide copies of all
          Suspicious Transaction Reports to the Guardia di Finanza, which carries out tax audits
          and investigates suspected tax offences. Following a tax audit, the Guardia di Finanza
          reports to the Italian Revenue Agency any information that would be relevant in the
          assessment of taxes, such as evidence of non-criminal tax avoidance. In the Netherlands,
          the tax administration has no access to Unusual Transaction Reports. Where the FIU
          determines that there is sufficient evidence of possible criminal activity for an Unusual
          Transaction Report to be categorised as a Suspicious Transaction Report, this may be
          accessed directly by FIOD, which is the criminal investigations division of the
          Netherlands tax administration. FIOD may subsequently decide not to pursue a criminal
          investigation, but may share the Suspicious Transaction Report with the tax
          administration‟s civil division for use in assessing taxes.
     (ii) Availability to agencies investigating tax offences
               FIUs in all countries may receive Suspicious Transaction Reports which identify
          other predicate offences and lead the FIU to suspect that a tax offence may also have
          taken place. This is particularly the case in countries where tax crimes are predicate
          offences for money laundering purposes, where the FIU may receive Suspicious
          Transaction Reports specifically identifying possible tax offences. Other work and
          analyses conducted by an FIU may reveal information that could be directly relevant to
          the investigation of tax offences. All FIUs may therefore hold information which would
          be of interest to officials investigating tax offences. The table below shows the ability of
          the agency responsible for investigating tax crimes in a country to obtain relevant
          information from the FIU.

               In five countries, the agency responsible for tax investigations has direct access to
          FIU information. Of these five, three (Ireland, the Netherlands and the
          United Kingdom) have FIUs established within the police or public prosecutor‟s office,
          whereas the other two (Australia and the United States) have FIU‟s established as
          separate agencies. This indicates that there is no clear link between granting direct access
          to FIU information, and the model under which the FIU is established. In Ireland, the
          Revenue receives copies of all Suspicious Transaction Reports directly from regulated
          businesses. Specialists within the tax administration and FIU meet regularly to discuss
          their analyses of Reports and co-ordinate investigations where evidence of tax and non-
          tax offences exists. Broad legal gateways also allow the Irish FIU, which is part of the
          police, to share information with respect to tax offences. In the Netherlands, the tax
          administration does not have access to Unusual Transaction Reports, which are received
          by the FIU from businesses. Where the FIU determines that there is sufficient evidence of
          possible criminal activity for the report to be categorised as a Suspicions Transaction
          Report, this may be accessed directly by FIOD.
               In 13 countries, the FIU has an obligation to report all information relating to possible
          tax offences to the agency responsible for conducting investigations. There is a clearer
          correlation between these countries and the model adopted for the FIU. In ten of these
          countries (Belgium, Chile, the Czech Republic, India, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Slovenia,
          South Africa and Spain), the FIU is established as a separate agency, or as a division of
          a financial regulator. In Italy, tax crime investigations are conducted by the Guardia di
          Finanza, under supervision of the courts. The Italian FIU is required to share all
          Suspicious Transaction Reports and its financial analyses with the Nucleo Speciale di
          Polizia Valutaria („NSPV‟), which is part of the Guardia di Finanza. In addition, a
          Memorandum of Understanding between the agencies provides that the FIU will provide
          to the Guardia di Finanza any information it obtains that is relevant to the agency‟s
          activities. In Slovenia, tax offences are investigated by the police. The Slovenian FIU
          must inform the tax administration and police if it obtains information that leads it to
          suspect tax crime has been committed. Otherwise, the FIU does not provide any
          information to the tax administration, or to the police that is related to tax crimes. The
          FIU does not provide information to these agencies on request.

               The Spanish tax administration does not have direct access to Suspicious Transaction
          Reports held by the FIU. However, under a memorandum of understanding signed in
          2006, the FIU must spontaneously inform the tax administration if its analyses suggest
          that tax crime or other non-compliance exists, which may be used to conduct further
          investigations and also in the administration and assessment of taxes. The tax
          administration may also request further information on particular taxpayers. Where the
          FIU has previously sent reports on the same persons to the police or public prosecutor,
          the FIU will inform the tax administration, so the tax administration may seek
          information from the recipient of the report. The FIU must also inform the public
          prosecutor or judicial authority, which has responsibility for directing tax crime
          investigations in Spain, if it obtains any evidence or indications of criminal offences.
               In only three countries (Germany, Iceland and Portugal) do FIUs established within
          the police or public prosecutor‟s office have an obligation to report information
          concerning tax offences to criminal tax investigators. Where the Portuguese tax
          administration is conducting a criminal investigation into a tax offence, the official
          co-ordinating the investigation may require the FIU to grant it real-time access to the
          police Integrated System for Criminal Investigation, which includes FIU information.
          Where the FIU receives Suspicious Transaction Reports that contain details of possible
          tax offences, the FIU may send a summary of the Report, but not the Suspicious
          Transaction Report itself, to the tax administration. This summary contains basic
          information regarding the financial transactions carried out and the parties to these
          transactions. If the referral results in a criminal investigation, the tax administration may
          then require the FIU to disclose further information.
               In 12 countries, the FIU is able to provide relevant information concerning tax
          offences to tax crime investigators, though is not under an obligation to do so. Out of
          these 12 FIUs, eight (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, New Zealand,
          Norway, the Slovak Republic and Sweden) are established as units of the police or
          public prosecutor‟s office, with four (Canada, France, Greece and Turkey) being
          agencies under the Ministry of Finance. In New Zealand processes are in place to ensure
          that any Suspicious Transaction Reports concerning possible tax evasion are forwarded to
          the tax administration by the FIU without requiring a request. The tax administration also
          makes extensive use is targeted information requests to obtain FIU data in relation to
          specific taxpayers, and high risk demographics and regions for use in detecting offshore
          tax evasion. In Norway, the FIU may provide information spontaneously to the police,
          which is responsible for investigating tax offences, and also to the tax administration. The
          FIU is not obliged to provide information to either agency, and the Norwegian police and
          tax administration are not able to request information from the FIU. In Canada, in
          2010/2011 $27.9 million of additional federal tax revenue was raised following
          disclosures received directly from the FIU or via the police.
               In Switzerland the FIU is not authorised to share information it holds with the
          country‟s federal or cantonal tax administrations, which are responsible for investigating
          tax offences. The Swiss FIU is an administrative body within the Federal Office of
          Police. In Japan, the FIU is not authorised to disseminate FIU information, including
          Suspicious Transaction Reports, for the purpose of investigating tax offences, as these
          offences are not included in the definition of predicate offence for money laundering
          purposes under Japanese law.

     (iii) Availability to the police or public prosecutor investigating non-tax offences
                With very few exceptions, FIUs are not responsible for conducting criminal
          investigations. Therefore, it is essential that robust gateways are in place to enable an FIU
          to provide information to law enforcement agencies which are competent to investigate
          offences identified through the FIU‟s activities. The table below shows the ability of

                In all countries included in this report, legal gateways exist to enable the FIU to
          provide information concerning criminal activities spontaneously to the police or public
          prosecutor, or for investigators to access FIU information directly.
                In five countries, the police have direct access to information held by the FIU. In
          Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the FIU is established within the
          police or public prosecutor‟s office. The Australian FIU is a separate agency under the
          Attorney-General‟s Department. In the United States, the FIU is an agency supervised
          by the Treasury Department. There does not seem to be any clear link between FIUs that
          permit direct access to information for the police and the model used to establish the FIU.
          However, all five countries also allowed direct access to FIU information for tax crime
          investigators, which in each case are based within the tax administration and not the
          police. This suggests that in these countries there is an emphasis on sharing FIU
          information with both tax and non-tax criminal investigators, regardless of the different
          organisational models applied.
                In 18 countries, the FIU has an obligation to report information related to non-tax
          offences to the police or public prosecutor. In 12 of these (Belgium, Chile, the
          Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain
          and Turkey) the FIU is established as an agency under the Ministry of Finance or within

          a financial regulator. In Belgium, the FIU is established jointly under the Ministries of
          Finance and Justice. Since 16 April 2012 the Belgian Central Seizure and Confiscation
          Office (OCSC), which is part of the public prosecutor‟s office, and the FIU can share
          information concerning the proceeds of crime. The Slovenian FIU must inform police
          where, on the basis of its analyses, it believes there is reason to suspect money laundering
          or terrorist financing offences, or other specified offences carrying a possible prison
          sentence of at least five years, have taken place. In Italy the FIU sends copies of all
          Suspicious Transaction Reports and financial analyses to the Guardia di Finanza or the
          Direzione Investigativa Antimafia (Bureau of Anti-Mafia Investigation – „DIA‟). In 2010,
          97% of Suspicious Transaction Reports were sent to the Guardia di Finanza and 3% to
          the DIA. Under Italian law, the Guardia di Finanza, the DIA and the FIU are the leading
          agencies in the fight against money laundering. In Turkey, the FIU is under an obligation
          to share information relevant to non-tax offences with the public prosecutor. The Turkish
          FIU may also share information with the police, but is not under an obligation to do so. In
          six countries (Germany, Iceland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Sweden and
          Switzerland) the FIU is established within the police or public prosecutor‟s office. In the
          Slovak Republic, the FIU is required to provide the police with information relevant to
          criminal investigations, so long as providing this information does not jeopardise the
          FIU‟s own activities. In Germany, where the FIU obtains information relating to possible
          money laundering or terrorist financing offences, it must without delay provide this to the
          appropriate federal and Länder police forces.
               In nine countries the FIU is able to share information regarding possible criminal
          offences with the police or public prosecutor spontaneously, but is not under an
          obligation to do so. In seven of these countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Japan,
          Luxembourg, New Zealand and Norway), the FIU is established as part of the police or
          public prosecutor‟s office. In Norway, the FIU is able to provide information
          spontaneously to the police, but the police are not able to request information. This could
          act as an important restriction on an investigator‟s ability to obtain information held by
          the FIU, or to seek further details with respect to information already obtained. In
          Finland, the FIU may also conduct pre-trial investigations into possible money
          laundering offences. In Luxembourg, the FIU is established within the public
          prosecutor‟s office, thus allowing the close co-ordination of activities and information
          sharing between the FIU and prosecutors. In two countries (Canada and Greece) the FIU
          is a separate agency under the Ministry of Finance.
G. Information held by financial regulators
               The principal functions of financial regulators include maintaining the stability of the
          financial system, and ensuring the competence of market participants and providers of
          financial services. They may also have direct responsibility for combating crime related
          to financial markets, such as insider trading and market manipulation and in the course of
          their supervisory and regulatory activities collect and hold information on individuals,
          institutions and transactions, which may contain evidence of other offences. In a number
          of countries, financial regulators also act as an anti-money laundering authority,
          monitoring compliance with legislation by regulated entities. The need for agencies to
          have access to this valuable intelligence must be weighed against the fact that regulators
          often process large volumes of commercially sensitive information.

     (i)     Availability to the tax administration for the purpose of administering taxes
               The table below shows the availability of information held by financial regulators to

               There are generally few obligations on regulators to share information with tax
          administrations for the purposes of determining assessments. No country allows the tax
          administration direct access to information held by regulators or imposes an obligation on
          regulators to report information to the tax administration in the absence of a suspected tax
          offence. In ten countries regulators are able to provide information to the tax
          administration spontaneously. In 11 countries information is available to the tax
          administration on request only. In a further 11 countries there is a prohibition on financial
          regulators providing information to the tax administration for purposes of administering
          taxes. In Greece, in general information held by the Capital Markets Commission is not
          available to the tax administration for the purposes of administering taxes. However,
          information may be made available to the tax administration on request where the
          information was already included by the Capital Markets Commission in a decision to
          impose sanctions.
     (ii) Availability to agencies investigating tax offences
               The table below shows the availability of information held by financial regulators to
          agencies responsible for investigating tax offences.

               In contrast to the position with respect to information relevant to determining tax
          assessments, 13 countries have legal gateways in place to require financial regulators to
          report information relevant to possible tax offences to tax crime investigators. In
          Germany, this obligation only applies where there is a compelling public interest in the
          prosecution of such crimes or when a person obliged to furnish information (for example
          in a tax procedure) intentionally provides false information. In Greece, where the Capital
          Markets Commission obtains information concerning possible criminal tax offences, it
          must report this to the Economic Crimes Enforcement Agency (SDOE). Other
          information is made available to SDOE only on request.
               In 11 countries, regulators are able to provide information spontaneously to tax crime
          investigators, or a public prosecutor responsible for directing investigations, at their
          discretion. In the Netherlands, secrecy laws governing information held by financial
          supervisors are given priority over a general obligation to share information with other
          agencies, except where a strictly interpreted necessity condition is met. In practice this
          means that Dutch financial supervisors are able to provide information concerning a
          suspected tax offence to the tax administration, so long as the information is to be used in
          specific law enforcement and not for general intelligence purposes. The Dutch Central
          Bank and the Financial Markets Authority may only provide information on criminal tax
          violations where there is a direct link to their role as supervisor. In France, financial
          regulators are obliged to provide information spontaneously to the public prosecutor.
               In six countries, agencies investigating suspected tax offences may only obtain
          relevant information from financial regulators on request. In Austria and Korea, a
          prohibition applies to prevent regulators sharing information related to possible tax
          offences with tax crime investigators.
     (iii) Availability to the police or public prosecutor investigating non-tax offences
               The table below shows the availability of information held by financial regulators to
          the police and public prosecutors with responsibility for investigating non-tax offences.

               There are on average greater obligations on financial regulators to provide
          information to agencies investigating non-tax offences, than to those investigating tax
          offences. In 16 countries, where a regulator holds information concerning a suspected
          non-tax offence, it is obliged to report this to the police or public prosecutor. In Italy,
          where the central bank has reason to suspect a possible offence has taken place, it must
          inform the public prosecutor‟s office, which will generally direct an investigation through
          the appropriate police agency. Police may also request information relevant to
          investigations from the Bank of Italy, which will be provided so long as this does not
          breach confidentiality provisions. In Greece, the Capital Markets Commission must
          report to the public prosecutor any information it obtains which causes it to suspect a
          criminal offence may have been committed. Other information may be provided to the
          public prosecutor or court on request, subject to the condition that the information must
          be absolutely necessary for the detection or punishment of a criminal offence. In Sweden,
          financial regulators have an obligation to report suspicions of certain offences, such as
          insider dealing, to the public prosecutor. Other relevant information may be provided to
          the police or prosecution at the regulator‟s discretion. In ten countries financial regulators
          are able to provide the police or public prosecutor with information relevant to a
          suspected non-tax offence, but are under no obligation to do so. In six countries,
          regulators may only provide information on request. No country imposes a blanket
          prohibition on regulators providing information relevant to possible non-tax offences.
     (iv) Availability to the Financial Intelligence Unit
               The table below shows the availability of information held by financial regulators to

               Regulators in 16 countries must inform the FIU if they obtain information that leads
          them to suspect money laundering concerning a regulated entity. In Finland, the
          Financial Supervisory Authority may also disclose any other information required by the
          FIU for the purposes of a pre-trial investigation. In Italy information held by the central
          bank and other Italian financial supervisors typically cannot be shared with other
          agencies. However, specific legislation provides that secrecy restrictions cannot be
          imposed between the financial regulators and the FIU. Subsequently, the Italian FIU has
          signed memoranda of understanding with the Bank of Italy and the Insurance Supervisory
          Authority setting out obligations for the bodies to share information and to co-operate in
          combating money laundering and ensuring effective supervision. A further memorandum
          of understanding is currently under negotiation between the FIU and Securities
          Supervisory Authority. In France, the central bank must provide information relevant to
          suspected money laundering or terrorist financing activities directly to the FIU. Other
          French financial regulators must provide information to the public prosecutor‟s office
          with respect to any sums or transactions that they suspect relate to criminal offences
          punishable by more than one year‟s imprisonment, or to the financing of terrorism.
                In 12 countries, regulators are able to inform the FIU if they obtain information
          relevant to the FIU‟s activities, but are not under an obligation to do so. In the
          Netherlands, the Dutch Central Bank, the Financial Markets Authority and the Dutch
          Competition Authority are able to provide information concerning suspected money
          laundering to the FIU. The Bureau of Financial Supervision („BFT‟) is responsible for the
          supervision of lawyers, notaries and accountants, which benefit from greater secrecy and
          non-disclosure provisions under Netherlands law. In contrast to other regulators, the BFT
          is subject to greater restrictions on the types of information it may provide.
               In three countries, the FIU may only obtain information from regulators on request.
          Only 1 country (Korea) imposes a prohibition on regulators from sharing information
          with the FIU.

H. Examples of successful practices
                The box below includes some examples of successful practices in sharing information
          between agencies.
              Box 8. Examples of successful practices in sharing information between agencies
            A number of initiatives have so far triggered positive results in terms of fostering inter-agency
            co-operation and allowing different agencies to work more effectively and efficiently. These
            initiatives include the following:
              Co-ordinated response to Suspicious Transaction Reports by the tax administration
                  and FIU (Ireland and Turkey): Legislation in Ireland requires financial institutions and
                  other reporting entities to submit Suspicious Transaction Reports to both the tax
                  administration and the FIU, and broad legal gateways permit the agencies to share
                  information. Following the introduction of the requirement to submit Suspicious
                  Transaction reports to the tax administration in 2003, the Irish Revenue carried out
                  extensive discussions with financial institutions. These emphasised the obligation to submit
                  Suspicious Transaction Reports where there were suspicions of money laundering and the
                  predicate offence was a possible tax crime. This campaign was successful and contributed
                  to an increase in Suspicious Transaction Reports submitted from approximately 3,000 in
                  2003, to 5,000 in 2004 and 14,000 in 2008. Approximately 80% of Suspicious Transaction
                  Reports received relate to possible tax offences. Since 2003, the Irish tax administration has
                  settled 578 civil tax assessments supported by information contained in Suspicious
                  Transaction reports, with additional tax revenue raised of EUR60.1 million. There are
                  currently 25 tax crime prosecutions ongoing in Ireland, which were initiated from
                  information in Suspicious Transaction Reports. Specialists from the FIU and the tax meet
                  regularly to discuss their analyses of Suspicious Transaction Reports and to co-ordinate
                  investigations where evidence exists of both tax and non-tax offences, as well as discuss
                  broader operational issues related to money laundering investigations. The FIU and tax
                  administration also each attend feedback fora between the other agency and businesses
                  required to submit Suspicious Transaction Reports. This ensures the agencies display a
                  united front in their dealings with the public.
                  In Turkey, in 2009 and 2010 the FIU received Suspicious Transaction Reports related to
                  possible usury carried out using Point of Sale (POS) machines. Specialists within the FIU
                  analysed these reports and determined that, in addition to usury, the predicate offences
                  underlying the Suspicious Transaction Reports included possible tax crimes. The FIU
                  immediately shared its analysis with the Tax Inspection Board, which conducts tax crime
                  investigations in Turkey. The Board started a number of investigations, during which
                  officials identified additional unreported taxable income and evidence of tax offences. The
                  Tax Inspection Board shared the results of its investigations with the FIU, which resulted in
                  the FIU submitting the case to the public prosecutor‟s office for prosecution of money
                  laundering offences.

                                                               (cont.)
              Access to Suspicious Transaction Reports for the tax administration (Australia): In
                 Australia, the tax administration has a right of access to all FIU information, including
                 direct access to all Suspicious Transaction Reports, via a secure online connection. This
                 may be used for any purpose relating to the administration of taxes and the enforcement of
                 tax law. The FIU also provides the tax administration with complete data sets of STR
                 information, which the tax administration uses in its automated data matching and data
                 mining programmes.
              Access to tax information for the FIU and co-operation between the FIU and financial
                 regulators (Italy): Investigations into suspected tax offences identified by the Italian FIU
                 are conducted by the Guardia di Finanza, which has direct access to information held by
                 the tax administration. The Italian FIU also has direct access to the Anagrafe dei Conti
                 („Account and Deposit Register‟) maintained by the tax administration, which includes
                 information on accounts and financial transactions carried out by financial intermediaries.
                 Since 2009, information obtained by the FIU from the Anagrafe dei Conti has been
                 extremely useful. In particular, this information has been used in analyzing Suspicious
                 Transaction Reports, improving international co-operation by providing information to be
                 shared with overseas FIUs, and in enhancing the effectiveness of inspections and audits,
                 especially those with respect to non-co-operative financial intermediaries. Legislation has
                 also been passed to allow the Italian FIU direct access to the Anagrafe Tributaria („Tax
                 Register‟) which, once implemented, will allow the FIU access to information on the tax
                 information of Italian taxpayers. The Italian FIU has signed memoranda of understanding
                 with the Bank of Italy and the Insurance Supervisory Authority setting out obligations for
                 the bodies to share information and to co-operate in combating money laundering and
                 ensuring effective supervision. A further memorandum of understanding is currently under
                 negotiation between the FIU and Securities Supervisory Authority.
              Use of covenants to improve co-operation between the tax administration and police
                 (the Netherlands): Police in the Netherlands may obtain information held by the tax
                 administration‟s tax compliance and audit areas only where an actual criminal investigation
                 is underway and a formal request is submitted. However, the police and tax administration
                 have entered into covenants that operate as permanent requests for information. The impact
                 of this is that the tax administration can, in effect, provide information spontaneously. In the
                 Netherlands, covenants are also used to facilitate co-operation with other agencies,
                 including financial regulators, public prosecutors and municipalities. Examples of
                 arrangements to share information using covenants include the Real Estate Intelligence
                 Centre, Financial Expertise Centre and Regional Information and Expertise Centres,
                 outlined in Chapter 4.
              An integrated approach to combating tax crimes between the tax administration and
                 police (France): In France, the Brigade Nationale d’Enquêtes Économiques („BNEE‟) is a
                 unit of around 50 tax inspectors that work within the judicial police forces and assist in
                 criminal investigations, as a liaison with the tax administration. In 2010 the Brigade
                 Nationale de Répression de la Délinquance Fiscale („BNRDF‟) was established as an
                 agency with specific police and tax skills to combat serious tax offences.

                                                      Box 9. Key findings
                      Sharing information is a necessary condition for inter-agency co-operation in
                       combating financial crime. In addition, certain countries have gone further and have
                       developed different models for enhanced co-operation, which enable agencies to work
                       together to their mutual benefit.
                      These models should not be viewed in isolation, but as forming part of a coherent
                       strategy, which involves agencies moving in the same direction to a common goal.
                       Although there is no limit to the ways in which agencies are capable of working
                       together, and countries should consider new and innovative methods based on their
                       needs and experiences, the report identifies several main models, namely:
                        Joint investigation teams: these enable agencies with a common interest to work
                            together in an investigation. In addition to sharing information, this enables an
                            investigation team to draw on a wider range of skills and experience from
                            investigators with different backgrounds and training. Joint investigations may
                            avoid duplication arising from parallel investigations, and increase efficiency by
                            enabling officials from each agency to focus on different aspects of an
                            investigation, depending upon their experience and legal powers. In some cases,
                            gateways for sharing information are wider when agencies are engaged in a joint
                            investigation than they would be in other circumstances. Countries that make use
                            of these strategies include Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, India,
                            Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Slovenia, Turkey
                            and the United States.
                        Inter-agency centres of intelligence: these are typically established to centralise
                            processes for operational and strategic information gathering and analysis for a
                            number of agencies. They can focus on a specific geographic area or type of
                            criminal activity, or have a wider role in information sharing. These centres
                            conduct analyses based on primary research as well as information obtained from
                            agencies. In some cases they access data through gateways available to
                            participating agencies, while in other cases they have specific information
                            gathering powers. By centralising these activities, officials within a centre gain
                            experience of particular legal and practical issues, and specialised systems can be
                            developed, which can increase their effectiveness. Cost savings may also be
                            achieved, as the expense of collecting, processing and analysing data can be
                            shared between participating agencies. Countries that make use of these strategies
                            include Australia, Finland, India, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States.

                        Secondments and co-location of personnel: these are an effective way of
                            enabling skills to be transferred while allowing personnel to build contacts with
                            their counterparts in another agency. Seconded officials share their skills,
                            experience and specialist knowledge while participating directly in the work of
                            the host agency. Countries report that arrangements to co-locate and second staff
                            have wider benefits for inter-agency co-operation, by encouraging officials to be
                            more proactive in engaging with counterparts from other agencies and improving
                            the effectiveness of co-operation that does take place. Countries that make use of
                            these strategies include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Ireland,
                            Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the
                            United States.
                        Other models: other strategies include the use of shared databases, dissemination
                            of strategic intelligence products such as newsletters and intelligence briefs, joint
                            committees to co-ordinate policy in areas of shared responsibility, and inter-
                            agency meetings and training sessions to share information on trends in financial
                            crime, guidance on investigative techniques and best practice in managing cases.
                            Countries that make use of these strategies include Australia, Austria, Canada, the
                            Czech Republic, Finland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the
                            Netherlands, New Zealand, the Slovak Republic, South Africa, Turkey and the
                            United States.
               Sharing information is a necessary condition for inter-agency co-operation in
          combating financial crime. However, countries need to go further and develop operational
          models that make the most effective use of gateways. Several countries have done so and
          have developed models for enhanced co-operation which enable agencies to work
          together to their mutual benefit. These models should not be viewed in isolation, but as
          forming part of a coherent strategy, which involves agencies moving in the same
          direction to a common goal. They go beyond gateways for sharing information by adding
          mechanisms for co-operative working or sharing practical skills and experience. These
          models appear to have potential to also generate additional benefits in relation to cross-
          border inter-agency co-operation, e.g. by acting as a one-stop shop.
               These models have been broken into four broad groups:
           i)    joint investigation teams, which may be structured as a permanent task force or
                 drawn together for the purposes of a specific case;
          ii)    inter-agency centres of intelligence, which operate as centralised bodies for pooling
                 information, skills and resources from different agencies;
        iii)     secondments and co-location of personnel, which enable officials from different
                 agencies to work together, share skills and develop contacts; and
         iv)     other strategies, which include shared databases, inter-agency committees, circulars
                 for sharing strategic intelligence and joint training programmes.

A. Joint investigation teams
               Financial crimes are complex. Criminal activity may include a number of connected
          crimes, or the individuals and organisations involved may be under investigation by
          different agencies for separate offences. Although legal gateways may be in place to
          enable agencies to share information, a number of countries have introduced mechanisms
          to allow agencies to co-operate directly in investigating offences through joint
          investigations teams. These allow for more direct and immediate sharing of information,
          and allow teams from different agencies to co-ordinate investigations to make best use of
          their technical skills and legal powers. Joint investigations can allow officials within
          different agencies to develop a network of contacts, increasing the level of understanding
          of each other‟s work and improving the efficiency of other areas of co-operation. They
          may also enable cost savings to be achieved by reducing duplication which could arise if
          several investigations were run in parallel. Countries using joint investigation teams to
          enhance inter-agency co-operation include Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark,
          Finland, India, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia,
          South Africa, Turkey and the United States. The Czech Republic has plans to
          introduce such inter-agency teams. Details of the arrangements and experience in a
          number of these countries are outlined below.
          Australia
               Project Wickenby is a multi-agency taskforce established in 2006 to protect the
          integrity of Australia's financial and regulatory systems by preventing people promoting
          or participating in the abusive use of secrecy havens. The Australian tax administration is
          the lead agency for the overall project, with other participating agencies being the
          Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Securities
          and Investments Commission, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the
          FIU, the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Government Solicitor.
          Special legislation was enacted to enable agencies to share information more widely for
          the purposes of Project Wickenby investigations than is generally permitted. The
          taskforce works with both Australian and international bodies to prevent, detect and
          combat abusive arrangements involving: secrecy havens; international tax evasion;
          breaches of Australian financial laws and regulations; attempts to defraud the community,
          including investors and creditors; money laundering; or the concealment of income or
          assets. By 29 February 2012, 65 people had been charged with offences as a result of
          Project Wickenby investigations, leading to 22 convictions and additional tax liabilities
          raised of approximately A$1.275 billion.
                Project Wickenby was the first multi-agency taskforce legislated to enable
          confidential tax information to be shared for the purposes of the taskforce. These
          purposes are broader than the general exemptions that allow tax information to be
          disclosed for the purpose of investigating a serious offence. This broader information
          sharing approach supported the development of joint strategic intelligence and decision
          making on the best treatment strategy for particular situations to optimise taskforce
          outcomes. This integrated joint agency approach has delivered unprecedented results and
          has been acknowledged by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) as setting the
          ""template"" for other taskforces in Australia. Subsequently, further taskforces have
          recently been established using a similar model to Wickenby, to tackle the organised
          crime threat - these are the National Criminal Intelligence Fusion Centre Taskforce and
          Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce.

"266","64 – CHAPTER 4 - MODELS FOR ENHANCED CO-OPERATION
               In the experience of Australia, the advantages of legislating broader information
          sharing abilities include:
                a rigorous approval process dictated by Parliament for prescribing taskforces
                 increases public confidence in that it has been established for a proper purpose;
                a taskforce has a shared focus and objective (rather than just working together);
                the fostering of cross-agency knowledge, intelligence sharing and capability
                 development to better assist each other; and
                a whole-of-government approach to tackle risk, which results in efficiencies and
                 better co-ordination and co-operation amongst taskforce agencies.
               On the other hand, Australia has also encountered disadvantages from this approach,
          including:
                the legislation used only focuses on sharing of information from the tax
                 administration to other taskforce agencies but does not consider the information flow
                 from the taskforce agencies to the tax administration. Reliance is placed on current
                 legal gateways to enable this to occur, but sometimes these gateways may be
                 restrictive and hinder the smooth flow of information between taskforce agencies;
                 and
                the establishment of a specialist taskforce may add additional and at times onerous
                 reporting requirements. For example, where oral disclosures are to be captured and
                 recorded for reporting to Parliament.
          Austria
               In Austria, the public prosecutor may authorise joint police and tax investigations
          into major cases of corruption and social or economic fraud. Joint investigations may also
          be authorised between police and customs.
          Canada
               In Canada, mechanisms exist for the tax administration and the police to work
          together in Joint Forces Operations, under two programmes established by the police to
          combat financial crime: the Integrated Proceeds of Crime initiative, which is responsible
          for policy development and implementation concerning the recovery of criminal property,
          including the anti-money laundering regime; and the Commercial Crime Branch, which is
          responsible for controlling and preventing business-related and white-collar crime,
          including fraud, offences against the Canadian government, corruption of public officials
          and counterfeiting. With respect to the Integrated Proceeds of Crime initiative, a
          Memorandum of Understanding was signed to specifically address the sharing of
          information between the tax administration and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The
          Canada Revenue Agency‟s criminal tax investigators are designated supernumerary
          constables and are embedded in the police unit, with access to police information and
          databases related to persons under joint investigation. Only once a court order is obtained
          or charges are laid can tax information be made available to both tax investigators and the
          police. In other working arrangements, such as Joint Forces Operations, when the
          assistance of the police is sought on a tax or joint case, legal gateways exist to enable
          sharing of relevant information between the police and tax investigators.

          The Czech Republic
               In the Czech Republic, there are currently no arrangements for joint working
          between the tax administration and the police. There are plans for establishing ad hoc
          joint investigation teams dealing with the individual investigations, together with a
          permanent joint special unit responsible for the organisation and co-ordination of such
          inter-agency co-operation. It is expected that joint investigation teams would include, as
          appropriate, agents from the tax administration, FIU, customs and police and in most (but
          not all) cases would be led by the police. These plans are currently under the review, and
          instruments are not yet in place that would allow information to be shared sufficiently
          freely for an efficient joint investigation. It is hoped that the first joint investigation teams
          should be established in 2012 or 2013.
          Finland
               In Finland, law enforcement agencies including the police, customs administration
          and border guard establish joint investigations teams, or taskforces, to combat serious
          offences. These taskforces may also include tax officials and officers from the
          Enforcement Agency. Finland is also active in participating in multi-national joint
          investigations, including 32 joint investigations under the EU Convention on Mutual
          Legal Assistance.
          India
               The Indian High Level Committee is headed by the Revenue Secretary and includes
          representatives of the central bank and all tax and major law enforcement and intelligence
          agencies, including the FIU. The High level Committee co-ordinates investigations under
          different areas of law and by different agencies into matters concerning the illicit generation
          of funds within the country and the illegal parking of funds in foreign jurisdictions.
          Luxembourg
               In Luxembourg, the Customs Administration, the Indirect Tax Administration and the
          Labour and Mines Inspectorate on a regular basis conduct joint investigations into the affairs of
          taxpayers, in accordance with the rules governing investigations by each participating agency.
          The Netherlands
               In the Netherlands, the National Police Squad and FIOD have two permanent joint
          investigation teams, both of which work on anti-money laundering cases. Of these two
          teams, one specialises in drug-related and violent offences, and is led by the National
          Police Squad. The other team specialises in financial investigations, and is led by FIOD.
          In addition to these two permanent teams, joint investigations teams may also be
          established where a case required specific expertise. The Dutch Police and FIOD work
          together closely in combating financial crime.
          Portugal
               In Portugal, the tax administration and criminal police are able to form joint
          investigation teams to work on complex investigations involving tax and non-tax
          offences. Typically, a team will include tax officials dealing with tax issues arising from
          the analysis of accounting and financial records and documents, and police officers
          dealing mainly with arrests, searches and phone tapping.

          Slovenia
               Since 2009, legislation in Slovenia has multi-agency teams to be brought together to
          work on investigations, under the direction of the State Prosecutor‟s Office. The
          composition of these teams varies depending on the demands of the case, and can include
          officials from the tax administration, customs administration, police, and other agencies
          as required.
          South Africa
               With the exception of the tax administration, South African law enforcement
          agencies frequently co-operate in investigating financial crimes through joint
          investigation teams, comprising specialists from each agency. In cases where the tax
          administration does assign tax officials to joint investigation teams, the official is unable
          to use any special legislative powers held by virtue of their position as a tax
          administration employee. More often, where suspected criminal activities include both
          tax and non-tax offences, the tax administration does co-operate with other agencies, but
          by running its own parallel investigation and sharing information with the joint
          investigation team.
          Turkey
               In Turkey the FIU and police are able to form joint investigation teams to work on
          complex money laundering cases. These teams include financial experts, who conduct
          analyses of accounts, assets, and financial records, and police officers, who carry out
          arrests, searches and phone taps with respect to the underlying predicate offence.
B. Inter-agency centres of intelligence
               Inter-agency centres of intelligence can be organised in different ways and for a range
          of purposes. The common theme is that they co-ordinate the sharing of information and,
          in some cases, practical skills between agencies. Inter-agency centres may be established
          to focus on operational information or strategic information. Operational information is
          that which is relevant to specific cases or investigations. Strategic information relates to
          the assessment of risks and threats, and is not specific to a particular case. In many cases
          the centres conduct analyses of data gathered directly or obtained from law enforcement
          agencies. In some cases, this information is obtained from agencies under legal gateways,
          while in others the centre itself has information gathering powers. As these centres
          provide benefits to a range of participating agencies, they can be a cost effective way of
          obtaining intelligence and analyses, with each agency gaining access to a wider range of
          experts than it would typically employ. By centralising the function of gathering and
          analysing data, inter-agency centres of intelligence can improve the effectiveness of
          existing gateways for providing information as officials within the centres gain
          experience in the legal and practical aspects of information sharing and develop contacts
          within other agencies. Inter-agency centres of intelligence may be established as a unit of
          an existing agency, or as a standalone body.
               Six countries reported that they have established inter-agency centres for analysing
          information and co-ordinating the work of different teams. These comprise those set out
          below.

               The remainder of the section briefly summarises the key features of each of these
          centres.
          Australia
          (a) The Australian Crime Commission
               The Australian Crime Commission („ACC‟) was established to combat serious and
          organised crime and is Australia‟s national criminal intelligence agency. The ACC is
          governed by an inter-agency board, comprising members from the tax administration,
          federal police, state and territory police, the Customs and Border Protection Service, the
          Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Security Intelligence
          Organisation and the Attorney-General‟s department. The ACC has coercive powers to
          enable it to source information that may be unavailable through traditional methods, and
          also maintains the national criminal intelligence database.
          Finland
          (b) The Grey Economy Information Unit
               The Grey Economy Information Unit („GEIU‟) is a division of the Finnish tax
          administration specifically established to work closely with other government agencies.
          The GEIU was established in 2011 to promote the fight against the grey economy by
          producing and disseminating reports about grey economy activities and how they may be
          controlled. In preparing these reports, the GEIU has the right to receive, on request,
          necessary information held by other authorities even where that information would not
          normally be available to the tax administration due to secrecy provisions. For these
          purposes the grey economy is defined as any activities that result in the failure to meet
          legal obligations for payment of taxes, statutory pension, accident or unemployment
          insurances, or customs fees, or to obtain unjust repayment.

"
"270","68 – CHAPTER 4 - MODELS FOR ENHANCED CO-OPERATION
               Another of the GEIU‟s key roles is the preparation of compliance reports at the
          request of another government agency. Compliance reports may be prepared with respect
          to any organisation, and include details concerning individuals and organisations directly
          or indirectly linked to such an organisation. Compliance reports may include details of
          business activities of individuals and organisations covered, their financial position and
          history and details of whether they have complied with legal obligations concerning tax
          and other payments, as well as other information necessary for the intended purpose of
          the report. Compliance reports may be requested for a number of purposes, including
          (among others): the levying and collection of taxes, and the enforcement of tax controls,
          by Customs; the prevention or investigation of an offence punishable by imprisonment of
          at least 12 months, by police, Customs or the Border Guard; the prevention or
          investigation of money laundering or terrorism; the monitoring of compliance with
          pensions law and collection of insurance premiums; and the determination of a forfeiture
          of criminal property. At the time a compliance report is requested, the requesting agency
          must inform the GEIU of the purpose of the report. In compiling a compliance report, the
          GEIU has access to all information from outside sources that would be available to the
          agency that requested the report, even where this would not normally be available to the
          tax administration. Where the information required for inclusion in the compliance report
          is held by an agency for the purpose of a pre-trial investigation, the GEIU must obtain
          specific consent from the agency holding the information in order for it to be used.
          (c) PCB Crime Intelligence and Analysis
               The Police, Customs and Border Guard („PCB‟) Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit
          is a joint venture between the three agencies. It has a National Intelligence and Analysis
          Centre, which is based in the Police National Bureau of Investigation headquarters,
          together with regional teams operating in each province. The purpose of PCB Crime
          Intelligence and Analysis is to promote joint operations between the three agencies, and
          to develop consistent policies to ensure that each agency conducts its own duties to
          prevent, detect and investigate offences effectively and efficiently. PCB Criminal
          Intelligence and Analysis is also responsible for maintaining status reports on serious
          crimes, including financial crimes.
          India
          (d) The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau
               The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau („CEIB‟) sits under the Ministry of
          Finance. The CEIB is responsible for the co-ordination of intelligence sharing and
          investigations amongst various law enforcement agencies, at both national and regional
          level. At national level, this is achieved through the Group on Economic Intelligence
          („GEI‟), and meetings of the heads of investigating agencies which are chaired by the
          Department of Revenue. At regional level the CEIB operates through Regional Economic
          Intelligent Councils („REICs‟).

               The GEI is primarily responsible for facilitating the exchange of strategic information
          on a real time basis between intelligence and investigative agencies, and regulators.
          Major issues on which the GEI focuses include the circulation and smuggling of
          counterfeit currency; tax evasion, illicit drug trafficking, terrorism and organised crime.
          Besides sharing intelligence, the GEI also takes up important issues relating to economic
          offences for detailed examination. The GEI, in co-ordination with other agencies, is
          putting in place a mechanism to control the illicit cultivation of opium poppy by using
          satellite imagery.
               REICs are regional agencies under the supervision of the CEIB, established to
          co-ordinate work amongst various enforcement and investigative agencies dealing with
          economic offences at regional level. There are 22 REICs functioning in different parts of
          the country. The REICs are headed by the Director General (Investigation) Income-Tax
          and the Chief Commissioners of Customs & Central Excise. All investigative and
          intelligence agencies including the Central and State Revenue Departments and the
          Economic Intelligence Wing of State Police are represented. The REICs are mandated to
          meet once every two months. Information is exchanged either directly between the
          member agencies or through the REIC forum. The REICs also undertake joint
          co-ordinated action on specific issues which are likely to have significant ramifications.
          Member agencies may also make specific requests to share information and
          documentation.
          The Netherlands
          (e) The Financial Expertise Centre
               The Dutch Financial Expertise Centre is a joint project between supervisory,
          investigation, intelligence and prosecution authorities involved in regulating or
          monitoring activity in the financial sector. The mission of the Centre is to enhance
          effectiveness in maintaining the integrity of the financial sector through inter-agency
          co-operation. This entails sharing information and increasing awareness of structural
          investigations or research projects and building the knowledge and expertise needed to
          safeguard the integrity of the financial sector.
          (f) Real Estate Intelligence Centre
               In order to combat real estate fraud in the Netherlands, the Dutch public prosecution
          service, the tax administration, FIOD (the criminal investigations division of the tax
          administration) and the police work together in a collaborative approach through the Real
          Estate Intelligence Centre.
          (g) Regional Information and Expertise Centres
               In the Netherlands, Regional Information and Expertise Centres serve as information
          points to provide specialist advice to municipalities and local authorities. They foster co-
          operation between local and provincial authorities, the public prosecution service,
          regional police and the tax administration in dealing with individuals and organisations
          that commit offences and regulatory breaches that have a particular impact at regional
          levels.

          Sweden
          (h) National and Regional Intelligence Centres
               National and Regional Intelligence Centres were established in Sweden in 2009, as
          part of an inter-agency strategy to address serious organised crime, including financial
          crime.
               The National Intelligence Centre („NIC‟) includes representatives of the Police, the
          Economic Crimes Bureau, the Prison and Probation Service, the Enforcement Agency,
          the Coast Guard, the tax administration, the Social Security Service and Customs. The
          NIC has a strategic function for intelligence analysis and an operational function for
          intelligence co-ordination. One of the NIC‟s main tasks is to compile a common threat
          assessment, which is used as the basis for strategic decision making by the participating
          agencies. The NIC identifies and maintains databases of indicators of organised crime,
          and of factors that facilitate organised crime, to be used in preventing and detecting
          offences. The NIC also co-ordinates flows of information between the Regional
          Intelligence Centres („RICs‟).
               The eight RICs are located at the headquarters of the local police authority and are
          responsible for conducting intelligence work in their respective region. The composition
          of RICs varies, but typically they comprise officers from all collaborating agencies, as
          well as from the Immigration Service. Officers assigned to a RIC generally work together
          for three days a week, with the remaining time spent working within their own agency.
          Each agency must provide their agents with technology to allow them to access agency
          information directly from the RIC‟s office.
          The United States
          (i) The Organised Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Fusion Centre
               The Organised Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Fusion Centre („OFC‟) was
          established in 2006 by the United States Department of Justice, Homeland Security and
          the Department of Treasury. The OFC develops and utilises technologies to provide inter-
          agency co-operation and analysis of law enforcement and intelligence data that has
          previously been impossible due to organisational and technical boundaries. The OFC
          collects, stores and analyzes information to support co-ordinated investigations focused
          on the disruption and dismantlement of significant drug trafficking and money laundering
          enterprises. All member agencies, which comprise IRS Criminal Investigations, the Drug
          Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Coast Guard, the
          Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the US Marshals Service, as
          well as the National Drugs Intelligence Centre and the Financial Crimes Enforcement
          Network (the United States‟ FIU), are committed to sharing their law enforcement data
          through the OFC. IRS Criminal Investigation‟s involvement at the OFC is centred on
          money laundering activities, and it does not provide tax information.
               The OFC utilizes human analysis enhanced by sophisticated link analysis tools to
          conduct comprehensive analysis of the available information, produce investigative leads
          for investigators in the field, and support the co-ordination of multi-agency,
          multi-jurisdictional investigations targeting the most significant drug trafficking
          organisations threatening the United States. In addition, the system offers a means to
          identify the most effective and efficient use of limited federal drug investigative and

          intelligence resources, both foreign and domestic, against these organisations. IRS
          Criminal Investigations is a principal member of the OFC and contributes resources and
          information for the purpose of producing analytical products, investigative leads, target
          profiles, strategic reports and field query reports. IRS Criminal Investigations has
          appointed one senior staff member to act as Section Director and two supervisory special
          agents to staff co-ordinator positions in the OFC‟s Financial Section. Currently the Fusion
          Centre currently has 75-100 personnel from all participating agencies.
          (j) Suspicious Activity Report Review Teams
               Suspicious Activity Report Review Teams („SAR Review Teams‟) consist of US law
          enforcement agencies from the federal, state and local levels and operate in 80 of the 94
          federal judicial districts in the United States. The Chairperson of the SAR Review Team
          is usually an Assistant United States Attorney, with the IRS Criminal Investigations
          playing a leading role. The primary purpose of a SAR Review Team is to systematically
          review all SARs (or Suspicious Transaction Reports) that affect a specific geographic
          jurisdiction, identify individuals who may be engaged in criminal activities, and
          co-ordinate and disseminate leads to appropriate agencies for follow-up. The composition
          of these teams, while varying by location, generally include the US Attorney‟s Office,
          IRS Criminal Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement
          Administration, the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; the Bureau of
          Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the US Secret Service, and state and local
          law police. A small number of SAR Review Teams also include an official from the FIU.
          (k) High Intensity Financial Crime Areas
               In the United States, High Intensity Financial Crime Areas („HIFCA‟) were first
          announced in 1999 as a means of concentrating law enforcement efforts at the federal,
          state and local levels in high intensity money laundering zones. In order to implement this
          goal, a money-laundering action team was created or identified within each HIFCA to
          spearhead a co-ordinated inter-agency anti-money laundering effort. Each action team is
          composed of all relevant federal, state, and local enforcement authorities, prosecutors,
          and financial regulators. There are currently seven HIFCAs, including Northern
          California, Southern California, the Southwest Border, Chicago, New York, South
          Florida and Puerto Rico. The use of HIFCA, and also SAR Review Teams referred to
          above, have enhanced co-operation between agencies and, by pooling resources, have
          reduced the time spent on investigations.
C. Secondments of personnel between agencies
               In a number of countries, agencies make use of secondments and the co-location of
          personnel as mechanisms to improve co-working between agencies. These strategies
          enhance the effectiveness of other forms of inter-agency co-operation, by improving the
          ability of agencies to recognise opportunities for co-operation, and to increase the speed
          and efficiency of information sharing. By enabling officials to work in close proximity to
          one another, these strategies also promote the sharing of skills, and allow personal
          contacts to be made which often help to build further co-operation in the future. Several
          countries have reported arrangements for secondments of officials to the Financial
          Intelligence Unit, the police and the public prosecutor‟s office. These arrangements are
          briefly discussed below.

          Secondments to the Financial Intelligence Unit
               In Korea, a number of agencies have seconded a number of officials to the FIU.
          These secondees are responsible for leading the analysis of Suspicious Transaction
          Reports relating to their area of specialism, and identifying those which should be
          investigated by law enforcement agencies. In 2012 these comprised nine secondees from
          the public prosecutor‟s office, eight from the police, seven from the tax administration,
          seven from the customs administration, one from the Financial Supervisory Service and
          one from the Bank of Korea. For the period of their secondment to the FIU, these officials
          cannot directly access information held by their own agency, but must access information
          through the usual FIU gateway. The Spanish tax administration has also seconded six of
          its officers to the FIU, to assist in analysing Suspicious Transaction Reports. As in Korea,
          seconded officials in Spain may share their skills and experience, but are not able to
          access tax information which, if required, must be obtained through normal channels
          using the FIU‟s dedicated point of contact within the tax administration. The
          Netherlands tax administration has seconded a number of its officials to work as liaisons
          in the FIU. These staff work alongside FIU personnel in analysing Unusual Transaction
          Reports, but have direct access to tax administration databases to support them in this. In
          Greece, personnel are seconded to the FIU from each of the agencies represented on the
          FIU‟s Board. These trained and experienced specialists work in analysing Suspicious
          Transaction Reports, with access to their respective agencies‟ databases. The Portuguese
          tax and customs administration has personnel assigned to a liaison group located within
          the FIU. In the United States, all large federal agencies, including the tax administration,
          have officials posted to the FIU, to act as liaisons in facilitating the sharing of
          information, typologies and trends. The United Kingdom tax administration has a small
          team embedded in the FIU since the mid-1990s, in order to fully exploit Suspicious
          Transaction Report data in the execution of its tax administration, law enforcement and
          other functions. In Belgium, three officials from the police work as liaisons within the
          FIU. In Finland, the Asset Recovery Office is located within the FIU. The Asset
          Recovery Office is mainly staffed by personnel from the Finnish police, but also includes
          one official from the tax administration and one from the Enforcement Authority. In
          addition, 17 multi-agency regional groups have been established across Finland to trace
          the proceeds of crime, comprising 38 officials from the police, 20 from the tax
          administration and 19 officials from the Enforcement Agency.
          Secondments to the police
               The Canadian tax administration has four investigators working directly with the
          police force out of police offices across Canada. Canada reports that this has resulted in a
          noticeable improvement in the effectiveness of information sharing between the two
          agencies when conducting Joint Forces Operations. In France, tax administration
          officials posted to work within the BNEE have direct access to tax administration
          databases, and facilitate wider sharing of information relevant to criminal investigations.
          In Norway, a number of tax auditors from the tax administration are embedded within the
          police to assist in tax criminal investigations. In the Netherlands, FIOD, the criminal
          investigations division of the Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration, has
          investigators working within the Dutch police. In Belgium, tax administration officials
          may be assigned to work with the federal police, typically within the Central Office for
          the Prevention of Organised Economic and Financial Crime (OCDEFO), which is part of
          the General Directorate of Judicial Police. These tax officials are also qualified police
          officers, and are assigned to investigations including complex tax issues. The Irish tax

          administration has a specialist unit to manage interactions with the Criminal Assets
          Bureau, which is part of the Irish police force. In addition, Irish tax officials are seconded
          to the Criminal Assets Bureau, to ensure an effective multi-agency approach to
          recovering criminal property. In Portugal, secondments and co-location of personnel
          may be used as a method of facilitating joint investigations, for example through tax
          administration officials who are located within the offices of the criminal police or public
          prosecutor. The United Kingdom tax administration has tax crime investigation staff
          seconded to the criminal and civil asset recovery teams at Serious Organised Crime
          Agency. These staff can use tax information and tax powers to assist the Agency in
          tackling serious organised crime.
          Secondments to the public prosecutor’s office
               In Italy, the Guardia di Finanza has personnel seconded to a number of agencies,
          including the public prosecutor‟s office. This has led to two particular noticeable
          improvements. Firstly, the close working relationship between officials enables fast and
          effective sharing of information between agencies. Secondly, seconded Guardia di
          Finanza personnel are able t apply their specialist knowledge of tax and crimes, and a
          „police approach‟ to cases, to add significant value to the work performed by prosecutors.
          Since 2009 the Bank of Italy has also had a specialist team of experts permanently posted
          to the public prosecutor‟s office in Milan, to support investigations into financial and
          economic crimes. In Belgium, officials from the tax administration are made available to
          assist the public prosecutor in cases which have a tax component. Tax officials assisting
          the public prosecutor have the status of Judicial Police Officer. Where an investigation
          concerns possible tax evasion, these officials may be instructed to provide an analysis of
          the case file before the prosecutor decides whether to undertake a criminal investigation.
D. Other strategies
               Countries have reported a number of further models for enhanced co-operation,
          including shared databases, intelligence briefs, inter-agency training sessions and joint
          committees, which are discussed below. These innovative approaches often supplement
          other models for sharing information or enhanced co-operation.
               In India, the National Economic Intelligence Network („NEIN‟) was established by
          the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau in 2007 as a database of economic offenders.
          Cases under consideration by all major tax, police, law enforcement and intelligence
          agencies are fed into the database, which serves as a single entity storehouse. Reports
          generated from the database are shared with interested agencies and are used by the FIU
          for cross-checking with their own intelligence. The NEIN database is also used for
          carrying out risk assessments.
               The Strategic Intelligence Section is part of the Canadian tax administration‟s
          Enforcement area and on a regular basis it receives information and strategic intelligence
          products from other agencies, including the FIU, the police, Canada Border Services and
          the Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada. These products include intelligence briefs,
          newsletters and assessments, but do not contain tactical or case specific information.
          Regular face to face meetings to discuss strategic topics are also held between the
          Strategic Intelligence Section and other agencies.

"
"276","74 – CHAPTER 4 - MODELS FOR ENHANCED CO-OPERATION
               In Austria, regular meetings and training sessions are held including officers from
          different agencies. This enables staff to develop and maintain personal contacts and have
          proved effective in improving the efficiency of joint working and information sharing.
          Inter-agency meetings to share strategic information relating to trends in financial crime,
          guidance on investigative techniques and best practice in managing cases, as well as
          cross-agency training sessions and conferences are also used in the Czech Republic,
          Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Slovak Republic. In
          New Zealand, these practices have produced synergistic benefits for all participating
          agencies. From the perspective of the tax administration, these benefits are difficult to
          measure, but have improved the agency‟s knowledge base which, in the long run, is likely
          to have indirect positive effects on tax revenue and prosecutions. In the Czech Republic,
          senior officials from the tax administration and FIU regularly meet to discuss trends in
          financial crime and the effectiveness of models for co-operation.
               In Italy, the Italian Revenue Agency and the Guardia di Finanza have formed a
          number of working groups to share information about tax evasion and criminal tax
          schemes, the persons involved, and methods of audit and investigation. These working
          groups develop common programmes for combating tax evasion and tax crimes and
          maximise the benefits from synergies between them. In the United States, the tax
          administration‟s criminal investigations division may share information on trends and
          typologies with other agencies but, outside of joint investigations, may not share any data
          that contains taxpayer information.
               In South Africa, mechanisms for joint working include inter-agency committees
          under the control of several government departments or ministries. These include the
          Multi-Agency Work Group, which seeks to improve compliance and identify systemic
          solutions to failures within the financial and procurement system, and the Anti-
          Corruption Task Team, which deals with prominent corruption cases. The Luxembourg
          Comité de Prévention de la Corruption was established in 2007 as an inter-agency
          committee to raise awareness within the public and private sectors of issues related to
          corruption, and to share related information. The Committee takes preventative actions
          and advises the Government as to specific measures to be adopted in the field of
          corruption. A similar inter-agency committee was established in 2009 with respect to the
          prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (the Comité de Prévention du
          Blanchiment et du Financement du Terrorisme).
               The Irish Money Laundering Steering Committee oversees the issuance of detailed
          guidance to ensure consistent implementation of anti-money laundering legislation. The
          Committee includes representatives of the Department of Finance, Department of Justice,
          the police, the Central Bank, the Attorney-General‟s Office and the tax administration, as
          well as representatives of the private sector and designated bodies. The Irish FIU and tax
          administration work closely together in co-ordinating investigations involving both tax
          and money laundering offences, and each attend feedback for a between the other agency
          and institutions that are required to submit Suspicious Transaction Reports under anti-
          money laundering legislation. This ensures that the agencies display a united front and
          consistent message in their dealings with the private sector.
               In Turkey, the Co-ordination Board for Combating Financial Crimes was established
          in order to evaluate the draft laws on prevention of laundering proceeds of crime and the
          draft regulations which will be issued by Council of Ministers, and to co-ordinate relevant

          institutions and organisations regarding implementation. The Co-ordination Board is
          chaired by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance and includes the Presidents and
          senior officials from agencies and bodies including the Financial Crimes Investigation
          Board, the Finance Inspection Board, the Tax Inspection Board, the Revenue
          Administration, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of
          Foreign Affairs, the Board of Treasury Comptrollers, the Treasury, Customs, the Banking
          Regulation and Supervision Agency, the Capital Markets Board and the Central Bank.
               In Japan, public prosecutors and civil tax investigators from the tax administration
          hold joint seminars on real cases to discuss problems and areas of possible improvement
          in their examinations and investigations. These seminars are a good opportunity for
          public prosecutors who do not have much experience in investigating tax crimes to
          discuss issues with colleagues from the tax administration. They are also valuable to
          officials from the tax administration in helping them to understand the perspective of
          public prosecutors in conducting investigations.

Co-operation in Fighting Tax
Crimes and Other Financial Crimes
Financial crimes are increasingly growing in sophistication. Criminals accumulate significant
sums through offences including drug trafficking, fraud, extortion, corruption and tax
evasion. Different government agencies may be involved in detecting, investigating and
prosecuting these offences and recovering the proceeds of crime. This report describes
the current position in 32 countries with respect to the law and practice of domestic inter-
agency co-operation in fighting tax crimes and other financial crimes. It outlines the roles
of agencies in different countries, existing legal gateways to enable these agencies to share
information and other models for inter-agency co-operation. The report identifies a number
of successful practices based on countries’ experiences, and makes recommendations on
ways to improve inter-agency co-operation.

          A    s Chair of the OECD’s Task Force on Tax Crimes and Other Crimes (TFTC), I am honoured
          to present the first global reference guide for Fighting Tax Crime: The Ten Global Principles.
          This report provides the framework for criminal tax administrations world-wide as they
          pursue criminal tax compliance. Groundbreaking achievements require significant effort,
          and one of the TFTC’s greatest accomplishments during my tenure is the realization of
          this global reference guide. The TFTC’s role encompasses both tremendous visibility and
          responsibility in the international community for equipping tax agencies worldwide with
          the criminal enforcement knowledge and techniques to combat international tax evasion,
          corruption, terrorism financing, and other financial crimes. The importance of this report
          will follow suit with TFTC’s Oslo Dialogue, in which the principles of whole of government
          co-operation were introduced.
                With over 25 years of experience in criminal tax, it brings me great pride to finally
          see tax crimes and financial crimes at the forefront of conversations and incorporated
          into the executive agendas, strategic plans, and legislative priorities of many of our global
          leaders and governing bodies. This resoundingly reflects the significance of the work of the
          TFTC and I am honored to have been part of this endeavor. Additionally, it is instrumental
          to witness the discourse on global financial integrity deliberated during the G7 and G20
          Summits. Many financial integrity NGOs estimate that roughly USD 1 trillion flows illegally
          out of developing countries annually due to crime, corruption and tax evasion. Now, more
          than ever, the need for increased transparency, inter-agency co-operation, and international
          collaboration is undeniable and duly recognized. This guide will solidify TFTC’s role in setting
          global standards, reinforcing best practices, and providing a venue to address global criminal
          tax compliance threats.
                Because financial crimes are global, borderless, and prolific, we must expand and
          enhance our overall effectiveness in combatting international tax evasion, money
          laundering, and other financial crimes for which we have purview by utilizing all

        available resources, techniques, and networks. We are in an era of global financial
        transparency, where countries are advocating for increased exchanging information with
        foreign counterparts, and pursuing revenue lost through tax evasion. With an increased
        globalized economy and technological advancements, we are witnessing transnational
        organized crime groups and other perpetrators abuse the vulnerabilities in our financial
        systems. These frailties can have a significant and devastating impact on national
        security. Criminal tax investigators, with our unique forensic accounting skill sets, are
        well positioned to combat these national security threats and pursue illicit financial
        flows that were either derived from tax evasion, international tax schemes, cybercrime,
        or terrorist financing. The ten Global Principles contained within this reference guide will
        arm and equip tax administrations and investigators with the best practices to promote
        efficient systems for fighting tax crimes for years to come.
             We hope that this guide serves as a true pillar for criminal tax organizations worldwide
        with the recognition that we are only as strong as our weakest link. Let’s continue to

          T   his is the first comprehensive guide to fighting tax crimes. It sets out ten global principles,
          covering the legal, strategic, administrative and operational aspects of addressing tax
          crimes. The guide has been prepared by the OECD Task Force on Tax Crimes and Other
          Crimes (TFTC). It draws on the experience of the members of the TFTC as well as additional
          survey data provided by 31 jurisdictions: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic,
          Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Indonesia, Italy,
          Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore,
          Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom
          and the United States.
                The guide shows that the fight against tax crime is being actively pursued by
          governments around the world. Jurisdictions have comprehensive laws that criminalise
          tax offences, and the ability to apply strong penalties, including lengthy prison sentences,
          substantial fines, asset forfeiture and a range of alternative sanctions. Jurisdictions generally
          have a wide range of investigative and enforcement powers as well as access to relevant
          data and intelligence. Suspects’ rights are nearly universally understood in the same way
          and enshrined in law.
                Increasingly, jurisdictions are taking a strategic approach to addressing tax offences,
          which includes targeting key risks and leveraging the tools for co-operation with other
          law enforcement agencies, both domestically and internationally. At the same time, tax
          crime investigations increasingly need to be undertaken with greater efficiency and fewer
          resources. However, data shows that the investment is worthwhile, with some jurisdictions
          being able to calculate the return on investment from the criminal tax investigation teams
          and reporting recovery of funds well in excess of the expenditure, ranging from 150% to
          1500% return on investment.
                The role played by criminal tax investigators thus contributes significantly to jurisdiction’s
          overall tax compliance efforts. The implementation of the 10 global principles around the
          world is critical in addressing the tax gap and supporting domestic resource mobilisation.
Recommendations:
                This guide recommends that jurisdictions benchmark themselves against each of the
          ten global principles. This includes identifying areas where changes in law or operational
          aspects are needed, such as increasing the type of investigative or enforcement powers,
          expanding access to other government-held data, devising or updating the strategy for
          addressing tax offences, and taking greater efforts to measure the impact of the work they do.
                In particular, developing jurisdictions are encouraged to use the guide as a diagnostic
          tool to identify principles which may not yet be in place. Jurisdictions which have made
          commitments to capacity building for developing jurisdictions in tax matters (such as the

        Addis Tax Initiative or the G7 Bari Declaration) are recommended to consider how they can
        work with developing jurisdictions to enhance tax crime investigation based on this guide,
        including through providing support for the OECD International Academy for Tax Crime
        Investigation and other regional initiatives.
             The TFTC will continue its work in facilitating international co-operation on fighting
        tax crime, particularly on issues where multilateral action is required to address common
        challenges.
             This could also include collaborating to create an agreed strategy for addressing tax
        crimes that have cross-border elements. Such a strategy could include identifying the risks
        of such tax crimes, defining the additional data and other mechanisms that are needed
        to more effectively combat such tax crimes and working towards ensuring that data and
        mechanisms are available and efficient in practice.

T    he guide is part of the OECD’s ongoing work on the Oslo Dialogue, a whole of government
approach to fighting tax crimes and other financial crimes.
      Drawing on the knowledge and experience of government agencies around the world,
this guide sets out 10 global principles for effectively fighting tax crime. Each principle is
described, and supplemented with examples and current practices from around the world.
      This guide is intended to serve three purposes:
1. Allowing jurisdictions to benchmark their legal and operational framework to identify
   successful practices to improve systems in the essential areas for an effective system to
   fight tax crimes;
2. Allowing the measurement of the progress of jurisdictions through regular updates by
   tracking and publishing progress in future editions of this guide;
3. Allowing jurisdictions to articulate their needs for training for both developing and
   developed jurisdictions, including by incorporating the guide into the OECD International
   Academy for Tax Crime Investigation1 curriculum.
      Naturally, jurisdictions’ implementation of the 10 global principles reflects the
broader context of their legal system, administrative practice and culture. It is up to each
jurisdiction to decide how best to implement the 10 global principles in a manner that is
most appropriate in the context of, and most consistent with, the organisational structure
for fighting tax crimes and compliance with the jurisdiction’s commitments and obligations
under international standards, conventions and, in the case of European Union Member
States, European Union law.
      In addition, each jurisdiction has a different definition of tax crime, and a different
organisational structure for investigating tax crime. As such, in this report, references to
“tax crime” are intended to mean intentional conduct that violates a tax law, and is intended
to be broad enough to accommodate the different legal definitions that may apply under
domestic law. It is intended to cover the violation of both income tax law obligations, as
well as indirect tax obligations (such as VAT or GST). This edition of the report does not
include other financial crimes such as the violation of customs, corruption, bribery or
money-laundering laws.
      This guide is presented in order to present a picture of current practices and allow
jurisdictions to review and evaluate their implementation of the 10 global principles,
especially in comparison to relevant peers. This guide includes tables and charts reflecting
statistical and other data supplied by 31 jurisdictions in response to a survey in 2017.
However, comparisons should be made with considerable care in the absence of uniform
law and practices across jurisdictions. In particular, the statistics compiled cannot adjust
for variations in terminology (legal terms and definitions), tax and legal systems; the size
                                                                                               11

             attitudes to tax risk and overall rates of compliance; and other compliance approaches /
             strategies applied (such as preference for civil penalties rather than criminal prosecutions).
             As such, the statistics in this guide should not be considered in isolation, but in the context
             of a jurisdiction’s broader approach to tax compliance and fighting financial crimes.
                   Finally, this guide does not yet include a compendium of details on how individual
             jurisdictions have implemented the 10 global principles. This compendium would be
             included in the next version of the guide in 2018, and which would also include responses
             from additional jurisdictions.
                   A list of the jurisdictions which responded to the survey on the 10 global principles
             is included in the annex, together with a brief summary of the agencies responsible for
             investigation of tax offences in that jurisdiction.

Ensure Tax Offences are Criminalised
 Jurisdictions should have the legal framework in place to ensure that violations of tax
  law are included as a criminal offence, and that effective sanctions apply in practice.
                                                                                          13

"294","﻿﻿1.﻿  Ensure Tax Offences are Criminalised
                       Principle 1: Ensure Tax Offences are Criminalised
            Introduction
                  1.	Most taxpayers voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. However, some
            taxpayers persevere in being non-compliant and use any means to evade their tax
            obligations. It is in respect of those taxpayers, for whom support and monitoring does
            not improve compliance, that criminal law plays an important role. Moreover, it enhances
            the general preventive effect that criminal law enforcement can have and reduces non-
            compliance.
                  2. Jurisdictions draw different conclusions as to precisely when the application of
            the criminal law is warranted. The provisions of the criminal law define the actions that
            are designated as tax crimes as well as the type of criminal sanctions that are considered
            appropriate. These defined actions and criminal sanctions will not be the same in all
            jurisdictions.
                  3. Wherever dividing lines between non-compliant behaviour and criminal
            behaviour are drawn, it is important that jurisdictions have the possibility of applying
            criminal sanctions in respect of violations of the tax law. From a preventive point of view,
            this is for several reasons: (i) to send a message about the integrity, neutrality and fairness
            of the law (that is, that nobody is above the law); (ii) to act as a general deterrent for those
            people that could be tempted to evade their tax obligations if the opportunity arose, by
            providing serious reputational and punitive consequences of criminal activity; (iii) to act
            as a specific deterrent for an individual that has been convicted and sanctioned in the
            past, so that they might be discouraged from doing so again. Actual enforcement of penal
            provisions for the purposes of punishment for those that have decided not to comply is
            essential for both doing justice and strengthening the credibility of the penal provisions
            and the legal system itself.
                  4. The criminalisation of violations of tax law also ensures the availability of criminal
            investigative and enforcement powers that are necessary to find the truth regardless of the
            co-operation of the accused. In some jurisdictions this also provides for a basis for domestic
            co-operation with other law enforcement agencies under criminal law and international
            co-operation under, for example, under an MLAT.
                  5. The precise way of criminalising violations of tax law will vary from one jurisdiction
            to another. Each jurisdiction has a different legal system, which reflects and interacts with
            the particular culture, policy and legislative environment.
                  6.   Whatever the particular details of the legal framework are, it will be most effective if:
                  ●● The  law clearly defines the tax offences that are criminalised;
                  ●● A criminal sanction applies if the offence is proven;
                  ●● More   serious offences are punishable by more serious criminal sanctions; and
                  ●● Criminal   sanctions are applied in practice.

          The law clearly defines the tax offences that are criminalised
                  7. The offences within the tax crime category may be defined in a general manner
          to capture a wide range of activities such as criminal actions that intend to defraud the
          government. A different approach is where the law sets out the specific offences in more
          detail, each with individual requirements as to the precise actions that constitute a crime.
                  8. Whichever definitional approach is taken, jurisdictions may also take different
          approaches to the threshold at which an act is classified as an offence. For instance,
          jurisdictions may criminalise actions starting from simple non-compliance, such as any
          deliberate failure to correctly file a tax return. Some other jurisdictions may apply the
          criminal law starting from a higher threshold, where the deliberate failure to comply with
          a tax obligation is accompanied by aggravating factors such as if the amount of tax evaded
          exceeds a certain threshold, if the offence is committed repeatedly, when taxable income
          is actively concealed, or when records or evidence are deliberately falsified. Alternatively,
          jurisdictions may have set a very high threshold to classify tax crime, such as organised
          crime for profit, or tax evasion accompanied by particularly aggravating circumstances.
          Common examples are included below:
           Category                           Examples
           Non-compliance offences (may apply ●● Failure to provide required information, document or return
           irrespective of intent or result)  ●● Failure to register for tax purposes
                                              ●● Failure to keep records
                                              ●● Keeping incorrect records
                                              ●● Making a false statement
                                              ●● Non-payment of a tax liability
           Intentional tax offences           ●● Destroying records
                                              ●● Deliberate failure to comply with tax law to obtain financial advantage
                                              ●● Evading tax or receiving refunds by fraud or illegal practices
                                              ●● Intentional reduction of tax using false documents, fictitious invoices
                                              ●● Counterfeit or forged documents to reduce tax
                                              ●● Intentionally or by gross negligence providing misleading information in a tax return to obtain
                                                 tax advantage
                                              ●● Fraudulently obtaining refund / credit
                                              ●● Tax evasion in aggravated circumstances such as considerable financial benefit or conducted in
                                                 a methodical manner
                                              ●● Theft from or defrauding the government
                                              ●● Obstructing an official of the tax authority
                                              ●● Accessory offences
           Specific offences                  ●● Entering an arrangement that would make person unable to pay tax
                                              ●● Committing tax evasion as member of a gang
                                              ●● Commercial commission of tax evasion
                                              ●● Illegal use of zappers or sale suppression software
                                              ●● Identity theft
                  9.      Jurisdictions should also criminalise the act of aiding, abetting, facilitating or
          enabling the commission of a tax offence by others, or conspiracy to commit a tax offence,
          (“accessories”), such as actions taken by professional enablers. Based on survey data,
          22 jurisdictions responded that accessories, including professional enablers, are criminally
          responsible, and in most cases can be held liable for the same offence and the same criminal
          sanction. In some cases, the person can be liable for an increased penalty, such as where they
          are a tax professional and their facilitation of the offence is considered to be an aggravating
          factor. There are also three jurisdictions which also apply significant civil penalties for
          professional enablers or promoters.

                  10. Jurisdictions may, for example, include these criminal offences within a statute or
            code covering all criminal activities, in a general tax act, in their income tax1 or VAT statutes,
            or other specific statutes. Whichever approaches are used, the legal provisions should state
            the elements that constitute the crime. This includes articulating the specific conduct or
            activity that constitutes the criminal act, as well as the required mental state of the person
            in committing the activity (such as intention, recklessness or gross negligence).
                  11. In addition to prosecuting individuals, jurisdictions should be able to prosecute legal
            persons and legal arrangements for committing a tax crime. For example, where tax evasion
            has been conducted by a company, there may not be an identifiable individual responsible
            for the crime, but the criminal actions may have occurred because of the combined actions
            of several persons undertaken in their capacity as representatives of the company. The law
            may hold the legal person or arrangement criminally liable for the crime, and also impose
            punishment on key actors such as directors, officers, agents or key employees of the legal
            person / arrangement criminally liable. The ability to hold entities criminally responsible

            A criminal sanction applies if the offence is proven
                  12. The legal provision should include a penalty if the elements of the crime are proven.
            Penalties should be designed to encourage compliance and prevent non-compliance by
            providing a credible threat. Any statute of limitations on imposing a criminal penalty should
            reflect the seriousness of the crime and the prescribed punishment. A practical consequence
            of having a sufficiently long statute of limitations for serious crimes is that it allows agencies
            with sufficient time to identify and prosecute criminal acts. This is especially important
            in respect of complex cases which can take a long time to successfully investigate and
            prosecute.

          More serious offences are punishable by more serious criminal sanctions
                 13. There is a range of behaviour that can constitute a tax crime. In order to achieve
          the objectives of criminalising tax offences stated above, more serious behaviour or crimes
          committed in graver circumstances should be punishable by more serious criminal sanctions,
          proportionate to the nature of the offence.
                 14. As discussed above, each jurisdiction will have its own approach to categorising the
          types of offences and the seriousness of these. Whatever the approach is, the seriousness
          of the offence should correspond to the seriousness of the consequences for the offender.
          Criminal sanctions are applied in practice
                 15. The law that criminalises tax offences should be enforced. Where the offence is
          proven in a court proceeding, the criminal sanction that is most likely to be effective and is
          appropriate to the facts and circumstances should be applied. Penalties should be applied
          fairly and consistently.
                 16. Depending on the case, imposing a monetary penalty may be appropriate. For
          example, in respect of surveyed jurisdictions where data was available, fines were imposed by
          the competent authorities in respect of violations of the tax law, as follows (in Euro equivalent):

                                     Tax Crimes
        Introduction
             19. To be most effective in addressing tax crimes, tax authorities need to have a range
        of strategies for encouraging compliance, to respond to the different attitudes of taxpayers to
        complying with their obligations. To ensure that the laws related to tax crimes are effective in
        practice, a coherent strategy for enforcing the law should be devised. An overall strategy can be
        described as a document which states the objective of the tax authorities, identifies the relevant
        risks of non-compliance with the tax law, and sets out the plan for addressing those risks. There
        should be buy-in from senior officials who are accountable for delivering the overall strategy.
            20. Generally, there should be an overall tax compliance strategy that covers the full
        range of compliance, from encouraging voluntary compliance, dealing with inadvertent
        non-compliance, to avoidance, evasion and serious crime. However, the specific strategy
        would be based on each jurisdiction’s legal system, policy, legislative environment and
        general structure of law enforcement. The figure below as an example shows the range of
        behaviour and measures that can be taken to enhance compliance.

        Identifying the risks and threats
             21. A strategy may be most effective if a threat assessment is first undertaken, because
        knowing the relevant threats will ensure the response can be targeted to address those
        threats. All tax authorities have finite level of resources, which must be allocated efficiently
        on the basis of priorities. To do this, the tax authority should have a process for identifying
        the threats that are posed to the enforcement of the tax laws, and how serious these are.
        Ideally a threat assessment includes current, emerging and future risks.
             22. The benefit of conducting regular threat assessments is that it provides a structured
        basis for actively considering the current, emerging and future risks. Such a process supports

          improved decision-making by informed priority setting on how to address the various degrees
          of non-compliance, including combatting tax crimes, more effectively.
                23. A threat assessment identifies the specific risks of tax crimes that are prevalent
          in the jurisdiction. This should take into account the particular context or environment
          (cultural, political, legal, economic and technological), and where relevant, draw on the
          insights of other agencies responsible for fighting financial crimes. It can be effective to
          prioritise the threats in terms of the likelihood of such threats being realised and the
          seriousness of the impact if such threats are realised.
                24. A number of surveyed jurisdictions take steps to identify and assess the threats
          on an ongoing basis. This often takes the form of regular environmental scans, intelligence
          and trend / forecast analysis. A wide range of intelligence sources tend to be taken into
          account to identify emerging threats, such as all available information from the tax authority,
          observations of investigators and feedback from completed cases, asset databases, currency
          transaction data, open source intelligence, and intelligence from other agencies such as
          police, social services, prosecution, corruption, procurement, labour agencies, customs,
          immigration or border authorities, as well as from the private sector and from members
          of the public. Several jurisdictions reported that the analysis of the threats considers the
          possible revenue impact, frequency of the threat, likelihood of threat materialising and
          coherence with other strategic priorities.
                25. The results of the threat assessment may assist in identifying specific needs, such
          as to establish a cross-agency task force to address a particular risk, to launch a public
          awareness campaign, to build technical capacity in a particular area, to engage with the
          private sector or to inform the need for changes in the law.
          Key elements of an overall strategy
                26. There are many different ways of designing an overall strategy. The following
          diagram illustrates a possible approach to preparing a strategy, including the need for the
          results to feedback into the revision of the strategy.1

"302","﻿﻿2.﻿  Devise an Effective Strategy for Addressing Tax Crimes
                  27. Taking account of the threat assessment, an effective strategy can be prepared
             which may include the following elements:
                       ●● Defining  the objectives / performance indicators / outputs. For example, this
                          could be organised around the goals of prevention, detection and enforcement.
                       ●● Articulating the resources available to address these risks (including legal powers,
                          funding, personnel, expertise, stakeholders in other government agencies,
                          sources of intelligence, investigation and enforcement tools including domestic
                          and international co-operation).
                       ●● Identifying the challenges for the tax authority in being able to address the risks
                          and how those challenges can be mitigated.
                       ●● Devising an operational plan for achieving the objectives for the identified risks,
                          using the available resources and tools and including criminal law enforcement.
                       ●● Preparing a communications strategy. This is important in order to shape public
                          perceptions and behaviour, as it can be a reminder of the serious criminal sanctions
                          that can be imposed and act as a deterrent when high profile cases are prosecuted.
                          It can also help to educate the public, and build public confidence in the fair
                          enforcement of tax laws.
                       ●● A  plan for periodically reviewing performance and measuring the effectiveness
                          and currency of the compliance strategy.
                  28. It is important that the strategy is based on wide consultation with all relevant
             stakeholders such as policy makers, investigators, enforcement and prosecution officials and
             other agencies such as AML authorities, in accordance with each jurisdiction’s legal system,
             policy and legislative environment and general structure of law enforcement. In particular,
             given that serious tax crimes are likely to raise other matters of criminal law such as money
             laundering (especially as tax crimes are in most cases a predicate offence for money laundering,
             as set out in principle 7 below), jurisdictions should consider including tax crimes in an overall
             serious crime strategy, or a strategy specifically for addressing financial crimes. For example,
             Finland has a national strategy for tackling the shadow economy and economic crime. Austria
             has both a specific Tax and Customs Compliance strategy as well as annual Internal Security
             Strategies which focus more broadly on economic crime and money laundering. The United
             Kingdom’s tax authority contributes to the National Strategic Assessment for Serious and
             Organised Crime. A number of jurisdictions prepare their strategies in co-ordination with
             other agencies, such as anti-corruption, economic crime units, police, the prosecutor, financial
             intelligence unit, customs, securities regulators and the ministry of justice.
                  29. It is also important that the strategy for addressing tax crimes includes a mechanism
             for criminal and non-criminal tax officials to share expertise, processes and intelligence. This
             is because the officials responsible for non-criminal tax matters and for criminal matters
             will often have a symbiotic relationship; for example, the non-criminal function will have
             relevant intelligence for investigating tax crimes, both on specific cases as well as general
             trends. Likewise, the criminal function will also have information relevant for civil tax
             compliance, including on cases where it was not possible to pursue a criminal conviction
             but a civil audit may be appropriate, or to inform of a criminal conviction.
                  30. Strategic co-ordination between the criminal and non-criminal tax officials will help
             to ensure a coherent use of resources, efficient prioritisation of cases and avoid duplication
             of efforts by both the tax administration and criminal law enforcement officials. It should
             also increase taxpayer compliance overall, provide a deterrent effect when the public is

          aware of the effective co-operation between the criminal and non-criminal functions, and
          enhance the perceived fairness for the compliant taxpayer. This co-ordination will have
          to also take into account mechanisms for protecting the rights of a person if and when a
          matter has criminal aspects (see principle 10 for further information).
                  31. Almost all surveyed jurisdictions had a process for civil tax officials to refer
          suspicions of tax crimes to the relevant authority, and in many cases there was a legal
          obligation to do so. Key features which ensured the effectiveness of this process included
          training for civil tax officials to be able to identify indicators of a crime; having a clearly
          identified and central contact point for sending referrals; using a standard form that ensured
          all relevant data was captured for use by the criminal investigation authority; and meetings
          for feedback between the civil and criminal investigators including during the process for
          deciding how to proceed with the individual referrals.
                  32. The numbers of referrals in surveyed jurisdictions, where data was available for
          2015 and 2016, was as follows:

                  33. The UK published its serious crime strategy in 2013, the Serious and Organised
          Crime Strategy.3 Although this is not specific to tax crimes but focussed more broadly on
          serious crimes (including financial and organised crime), it provides an example of the key
          elements to creating an overall strategy. It is organised around the following principles:
                                                  Pursue:

                   34. In the Netherlands, combined enforcement practices have been in place for
             many years through the use of guidelines and protocols. One example is the ‘Protocol for
             the Notification and Settlement of Fiscal Offences and Offences Relating to Customs and
             Allowances.’ This protocol describes a tripartite consultation for selecting cases for criminal
             investigation, made between the Tax and Customs Administration, the Fiscal Information
             and Investigation Service (FIOD) and the Public Prosecutor. The protocol sets out the criteria
             for making such decisions, including weighing factors such as the likely amount of criminal
             loss.
                   35. In addition, an annual ‘Enforcement Strategy Arrangement’ is agreed, in which
             the Tax and Customs administration, the FIOD and the Public Prosecutor agree upon a plan
             for dealing with violations of fiscal and financial law. The plan includes agreements for
             prioritisation of risks, co-operation in enforcement interventions as well media strategies.
             Increasingly in the Netherlands, the criminal law is linked with other forms of enforcement,
             supervision and compliance strategies rather than being treated as the final stand-alone
             element of the enforcement chain.

                            Principle 3: Have Adequate Investigative Powers
             Introduction
                    36. The purpose of a criminal (tax) investigation is to find the truth by investigating
             the alleged criminal (tax) behaviour. In conducting an investigation, criminal investigators
             will generally seek to find and analyse information for the purposes of determining whether
             or not a crime has been committed. Investigations can result in finding both incriminating
             (“inculpatory”) evidence and evidence that confirms innocence (“exculpatory evidence”).
             This is used for prosecution authorities to decide whether or not to prosecute the accused.
             As criminals seek to hide the criminal nature of their conduct, criminal law enforcement
             agencies need an appropriate range of investigative powers in order to obtain the necessary
             information. In particular, in the context of investigating tax offences, there is significant
             value in being able to effectively investigate the source and movement of financial assets.
             This can be essential to establish the commission of fraud, and to identify the role of an
             intermediary or accessory, even where the assets themselves have been moved.
                    37. Depending on which agency has responsibility for investigating tax crimes (see
             principle 5 for more details), the nature and extent of investigatory powers in a particular
             agency may vary. In general, the competency for conducting criminal tax investigations will
             fall within one of these four models, as described in the Effective Inter-agency Co-operation In
             Fighting Tax Crimes And Other Financial Crimes, Third Edition, 2017 (the “Rome Report”).
                                                  General Organisational Models for Investigating Tax Crimes
              Model 1                        Model 2                           Model 3                           Model 4
              Tax administration directs and Tax administration conducts       Specialist agency outside tax     Police or public prosecutor
              conducts investigations        investigations, directed by       administration conducts tax       conduct investigations
                                             prosecutor                        offence investigations, which may
                                                                               involve public prosecutors
                    38. A tax administration conducting criminal tax investigations under organisational
             Model 1 may not have investigative powers, expertise or resources, such as the ability to
             search and seize, intercept communications and demand production of documents. If the tax
             administration is responsible for conducting criminal tax investigations but does not have
             the full range of investigative powers itself, these powers should still be available indirectly
             where needed, such as through the ability to call on the police or another agency to provide
             investigatory services.
                    39. Under organisational Model 2 and under Model 4, where the police or public
             prosecutor conducts and / or directs the investigations, the investigative powers most likely
             are similar to the investigative powers of the police conducting other financial investigations.
             Under Model 3, an agency separate to the tax administration is responsible for investigating
             tax crime cases, and the investigative powers are also most likely similar to the investigative
             powers of the police.
                    40. Whichever organisational model is used, the agencies responsible for investigating
             tax offences should have the investigative powers that it considers are necessary and

          effective in the context of its own mandate, and taking into account the ability to work with
          other law enforcement agencies which may have additional powers. These investigative
          powers should allow accessing information and evidence in the digital world in addition to
          the more traditional sources of information.
                 41. The availability of relevant investigative powers amongst survey respondents is set
          out below. Throughout this section of the guide, it is noted that the precise circumstances and
          legal procedures that need to be followed in order to use such powers vary. The representation
          of jurisdictions as having “direct powers” is not intended to reflect that the power can be
          used in all investigations of a tax offence, but that the agency is able to exercise the powers
          itself in the authorised circumstances (including circumstances where a warrant or court
          authorisation is granted to the agency). The reference to having indirect powers via another
          agency reflects an arrangement where the power would be exercised by a different agency
          outside the criminal tax investigation agency, such as by the police.
          Powers to obtain third party documentary information
                 42. The power to obtain information may be needed to access documents and
          information from financial institutions and other third parties. These powers require a
          third party to hand over documents or information within a specified amount of time. If
          the demand is not met, more intrusive powers that involve a physical search of property
          or digital media may follow. The power to obtain third party documentary information is
          particularly appropriate where the information sought is not readily available in a physical
          form (e.g. banks which do not maintain paper copies of a customer’s bank statements or
          telecommunications providers’ data) since this power allows the third party time to collect
          the demanded material. These powers can take the form of a subpoena, production order,
          or other powers to demand or compel the handing over of documentary information. This
          power is available in survey respondents as follows:

                 43. It is noted that this particular investigatory power may have the same purpose as
          the civil powers of tax examiners and tax auditors when conducting a civil tax examination,
          which is to obtain information. Since procedural safeguards should apply once a civil
          examination becomes a criminal investigation, in order to protect a suspect’s rights it is
          important to identify the point at which that line is crossed (see principle 10). In some
          jurisdictions civil actions need to cease at this point, while in others civil powers to obtain
          information for the purposes of the civil examination / audit may still be deployed and may
          run parallel to a criminal investigation.

                    44. However, deploying civil powers for the purposes of the criminal investigation may
             constitute an abuse of powers and any evidence obtained may be inadmissible in court.
             Procedural safeguards are of particular importance under the organisational “Model 1”
             referred to above, where the tax administration conducts civil examinations or audits and
             also has the authority to conduct criminal investigations. In such a model it is important to
             take measures or implement an organisational structure or standard operating procedure
             that prevents interference of civil audits / examinations with criminal investigations to
             prevent an abuse of powers occurring.
             Search powers
                    45. This investigative power refers to the search of property and the ability to search
             and seize physical evidence such as books and records and other materials that may be
             evidence of a tax crime. This power generally also allows the investigating authority to use
             reasonable force to enter the property if needed. This power is available in survey respondents
             as follows:
                                                                             Search powers

                    46. Search powers should be accompanied by corresponding safeguards that respect a
             person’s right to privacy and to be free from “unreasonable” search. As such, search powers
             may be limited by a requirement that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has
             been committed and that procedural authorisations be obtained such as a search warrant.
             Power to intercept mail and telecommunications
                    47. This refers to the power to review persons’ communications, including e-mails, on-
             line chats, social media, tracking devices and dial number recorders (devices which record
             incoming and outgoing telephone numbers), keyboard loggers, internet routing addressing,
             communications using the dark web and many other types of interceptions. This can be an
             important source of information to establish further inculpatory or exculpatory evidence, to
             establish a basis to obtain a search warrant, to identify potential search locations, associated
             persons and co-conspirators to the crime, and to identify criminal assets. Experience from
             jurisdictions shows that the power to intercept communications varies, as it is a relatively
             intrusive power and which may be used only in the most serious cases. This power is available
             in survey respondents as follows:

          Power to search and seize computer hardware, software, cell phones
          and digital media
                 48. Tax crime investigators may need to search and seize evidence which is in digital
          form, and be able to do so in a forensically sound manner. While the search powers to obtain
          evidence referred to above focusses on the search and seizure of physical evidence, this
          investigative power is focused on the ability to secure digital evidence such as e-mails, text
          messages, electronic documents and banking records. This type of evidence may be held
          within computer hardware or software, tablet, cell phone, or any number of electronic storage
          media including storage in the cloud. For some jurisdictions, this may be an area where the
          description of investigatory powers in the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly changing
          digital landscape, and may need to be reformed. This power is available in survey respondents

                 49. This power has become essential given the increasing use of technology to commit
          tax crimes and transfer of criminal proceeds.
                 50. During a physical search of a home or office, documents can be reviewed in a manner
          that quickly indicates whether or not they are covered by the search warrant and relevant to the
          investigation. However, digital media may contain hundreds of thousands of e-mails, documents
          and text messages, created over many years, and not necessarily related to the tax crime. It is
          therefore challenging, if not impossible, to determine during the onsite search whether or not a
          particular piece of electronic information is covered by the search warrant and of its relevance.
          Therefore, the search may comprise digitally copying or imaging the data that is held, and

             examining the contents in a forensic lab in order to determine which pieces of the information
             are within the scope of the search warrant and relevant to the case under investigation.
                  51. For example, in Australia, police have the power to operate electronic equipment
             found at a search warrant premises to access data (including data not held on the premises).
             If the data accessed is evidential material, it can be copied and remove by operating the
             equipment or, if it is not practicable to do so, seizing the equipment. A thing found at the
             warrant premises may be removed for up to 14 days for examination or processing in order
             to determine if it may be seized under the warrant, if it is significantly more practicable to
             do so having regard to timeliness and the cost of examining or processing the thing and the
             availability of expert assistance. This has proven particularly useful in large complex tax
             and fraud investigations, in which large amounts of data must be searched on the digital
             media in order to identify the relevant evidence.
                  52. There may also be legal challenges connected with the search and seizure of digital
             data in computers and other electronic devices. Personal data in an electronic device may not
             be relevant to the suspected tax crime, or may contain data protected by a legal professional
             privilege. This may require that the search is carefully governed to ensure it is limited to the
             terms of the authorisation. There may also be legal challenges connected with the search and
             seizure of computers and other electronic devices. This may be particularly pertinent in cases
             where the search powers contained in the law refer explicitly to searches or seizure of physical
             documents, or where a person challenges a search of digital media on the basis that it is overly
             broad and goes beyond the terms of the search authority or could include privileged documents.
                  53.	Based on survey data, the most commonly reported challenge agencies face in
             the search and seizure of digital media, involves data stored outside the jurisdiction or
             in the cloud, as their legislation only allows for the search of data which is locally stored.
             Jurisdictions also noted the challenges of searching large amounts of data, data protected
             by encrypted passwords, and data that is unable to be accessed because of secrecy laws.
             Possible solutions mentioned by jurisdictions included the development of an IT system
             able to sort the main relevant data and a special IT training for professionals in tax crime
             investigation.
             Powers to interview
                  54. This investigative power refers to the ability to interview suspects, accused persons
             and witnesses to obtain information.
                  55. The power to interview is generally a power to initiate an interview, rather than
             a power to compel a person to speak or to provide information during that interview. A
             distinction should be made between suspects, accused persons and witnesses. Whether or
             not a suspect provides information during the interview relies on the voluntary co-operation
             of that suspect. This reflects a suspects’ right to remain silent and right to protection from
             self-incrimination. For this purpose, suspects should be cautioned at the start of the
             interview. With respect to witnesses, although they do not have the same right to remain
             silent, legal privileges and professional secrecy provisions may be applicable, e.g. for family
             members or certain professions. This power is available in survey respondents as follows:

          inquiry powers which can subpoena potential witnesses before a tribunal or court to answer
          questions under oath. This can be a particularly powerful tool where a person is unwilling

             Power to conduct undercover operations
                     58. This power refers to the ability to conduct an undercover operation, where an
             enforcement officer takes on a different identity in order to obtain information and
             evidence. This strong investigative tool may be particularly important in the investigation
             of ongoing serious crimes such as identifying enablers of tax crimes and other financial
             crimes where organised crime is involved. The type of information that can be obtained
             using this investigative power is similar to that sought through covert surveillance, including
             establishing the identity of co-conspirators and location of assets.
                     59. The distinction between conducting covert surveillance to obtain this information
             and conducting an undercover operation is the embedding of the undercover officer, or at
             least direct contact of the undercover officer, with the criminal organisation for the purposes
             of gaining their trust to obtain information. The contact of the officer may be physical
             interactions or digital interactions such as on online platforms. This power is available in
             survey respondents as follows:

             and training of the officers involved. As such, undercover operations are likely to be used
             less frequently. As with the other investigative powers noted within principle 3, issues of
             suspect’s rights and protections such as privacy and issues related to entrapment must be
             safeguarded by correct legal procedures in the use of these powers.

          Power to arrest a person
                 61. The power to arrest a person refers to the power to stop, restrain and take a person
          into custody, often for the purpose of formally charging them with an offence. The power to
          arrest a person and to take them into custody (with or without restrictions) can be critical
          during a tax crime investigation, as to prevent them from influencing other suspects or
          witnesses as well as when there is a risk of flight by the accused or suspect, or to restrain
          this person in order to prevent them from committing additional crimes. This power is

                 62. In some jurisdictions, the arrest and custody of an accused or suspect also provides
          continuous availability for interviewing the suspect or accused for a certain period of time,
          subject to certain protections under the law.
                 63. As is the case with the use of investigative powers by any law enforcement agency,
          these must be accompanied by safeguards, oversight, and authorisations to ensure that the
          suspects and accused persons are adequately protected from any potential abuse of these
          investigative powers (see principle 10 for more details).

                                              and Confiscate Assets
             Introduction
                   64. Freezing or seizing of assets is “temporarily prohibiting the transfer, conversion,
             disposition or movement of assets or temporarily assuming custody or control of assets
             on the basis of an order issued by a court or other competent authority.”1 Freezing is an
             action that temporarily suspends rights over the asset, and for example may apply to bank
             accounts which are fungible. Seizure is an action to temporarily restrain an asset or put it
             into the custody of the government, and for example may apply to physical assets such as a
             vehicle. Generally, freezing / seizing is used to temporarily prevent the movement of assets
             pending the outcome of a case. Confiscation of assets can be defined as “the permanent
             deprivation of assets by order of a court or other competent authority.”2 Confiscation (which
             may be referred to as asset forfeiture) is generally used after the final outcome of a case,
             as it is a final measure that stops criminals from accessing assets obtained from a crime.
             Freezing / seizing and confiscation powers must be exercised in accordance with national
             law, including requirements as to proportionality.
                   65. In order to be able to successfully conduct criminal investigations and to ensure that
             the assets that gave rise to or are the product of tax crime are adequately secured throughout
             the investigations, it is important that the investigation agencies can freeze / seize such
             assets for the duration of the investigation and the criminal procedure. As noted above, in
             the investigation of tax offences, being able to interrupt the movement of financial assets
             can be essential in identifying or preventing an offence. In addition, agencies should have
             the authority to confiscate assets that gave rise to or are the product of tax crimes. This is
             particularly relevant in fighting tax crimes, as financial assets are easily removed from one
             jurisdiction to another and cause financial damage for governments.
                   66. Freezing / seizing and confiscation of assets are necessary in order to prevent the
             proceeds of a crime from being disposed of or being enjoyed by a suspect, or to preserve physical
             evidence of a crime. In some jurisdictions, the confiscation / forfeiture may be a sanction on
             its own, or also a way to ensure pecuniary fines are paid. Freezing, seizing and confiscation
             disrupts criminal activity by inhibiting access to assets that would have been beneficial to the
             individual or organisation committing the crime or can prevent the criminal assets from being
             employed to commit further crimes. The freezing / seizing and confiscating of criminal assets
             is also a deterrent measure as it can reduce the profitability of committing tax crimes.
                   67. The availability of relevant freezing, seizing and confiscation powers amongst
             survey respondents is set out below. Throughout this section of the guide, it is noted that
             the precise circumstances and legal procedures that need to be followed in order to use
             freezing / seizing or confiscations measures vary. The representation of jurisdictions as
             having a particular mechanism “available” is not intended to reflect that the mechanism
             can be used in all investigations of a tax offence, but that the mechanism is available at

                  70. The available mechanisms for the freezing, seizing and confiscating of assets will
          vary between jurisdictions, but the following types of mechanisms may be relevant to
          consider. Whether all of the below mechanisms are available in a particular jurisdiction
          or in a particular agency will depend on the organisational structure for investigating tax
          offences and taking enforcement actions, as well as the particular legal system which may
          not permit certain mechanisms which involve the deprivation of assets.
          Rapid freezing of assets
                  71. Speed can be essential when it comes to freezing and seizing assets, as criminals
          can quickly transfer funds out of the agencies’ reach or dispose of property if they become
          aware that the criminal investigation agencies are investigating them. The legal authority
          and operational capacity to freeze assets rapidly in urgent cases is relevant, for example,

          Non-conviction based confiscation
                 75. This means the power to seize assets without a criminal trial and conviction. Non-
          conviction based confiscation is an enforcement action taken against the asset itself and
          not the individual. It is a separate action from any criminal proceeding and requires proof
          that the property is the proceeds or an instrumentality of crime. In some jurisdictions, the
          criminal conduct must be established using a standard of proof of the balance of probabilities,
          which reduces the burden for the agency and means that it may be possible to obtain the
          assets even where there is insufficient evidence to support a criminal conviction. This power
          is available in respect of tax crimes in survey respondents as follows:

                 76. In order to effectively recover criminal assets, jurisdictions should consider the
          following:
                      ●● Having the necessary governance framework to ensure criminal law enforcement
                          agencies operate transparently, and are adequately supervised in connection with
                          the handling of assets to ensure integrity;
                      ●● Having        the necessary investigative, legal and operational expertise;
                      ●● Putting        in place a clear organisational structure to manage asset cases. Given
                          that these cases can require specialised investigative and legal expertise which
                          may be located across different agencies, it can be efficient to put in place a
                          specialised multi-agency unit with trained practitioners and adequate resources
                          focussing on asset recovery;

                                                    with Defined Responsibilities
              Introduction
                      77. A range of organisational models exists for allocating the responsibilities for
              investigating and prosecuting tax crimes. The model adopted in a particular jurisdiction is
              likely to take into account the jurisdiction’s history, its general structure of law enforcement
              and its legal system.
                      78. Having a clear organisational model is important because it will allow for efficient
              allocation of responsibilities, which can reduce the risk of duplication of efforts and gaps in
              law enforcement. A clear organisational structure is also important as it allows for greater
              transparency and accountability for the use of resources and deployment of strategies. The
              organisational structure should ensure that the agency responsible for the investigation
              and prosecution of tax crimes is independent of personal or political interests, and is also
              held accountable for exercising its functions with fairness and integrity.
                      79. Understanding the particular organisational structure that is in place in the
              jurisdiction is important because it will inform how a jurisdiction can best implement a
              number of the other global principles. For example, the organisational structure will affect
              the design of the overall compliance strategy, the range of investigatory powers that should
              be granted, allocating the appropriate amount of resources, and devising strategies for inter-
              agency co-operation and international co-operation.
                                               Generally, there are four organisational models:
                                                         General Organisational Models for Investigating Tax Crimes

                      80. However, in some jurisdictions a combination of models may be used depending
              on the circumstances of the case, or another model altogether may be in place.
                      81. Whichever organisational model is used, it is important that the agency or
              agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting tax crimes have clearly defined
              responsibilities. This will help to ensure that responsibility for all aspects of fighting
              tax crimes are clearly designated, as well as to reduce the possibility of inefficient

          and supervision), and the appropriate investigative powers (see principle 3) and adequate
          resources (see principle 6). The organisational structure should also be clearly aligned

             Introduction
                    83. Whatever the organisational model, sufficient resources should be allocated to
             investigate and take enforcement action in respect of tax crimes. The level and type of
             resources will vary in accordance with the overall budgetary constraints and other budgetary
             priorities for the jurisdiction. In particular the type of resources needed may vary depending
             on the nature, scale and developmental stage of the economy. For example, it may be more
             urgent to build the legal and physical infrastructure before acquiring advanced analytical
             and technology tools.
                    84.	Moreover, the allocation of resources to different functions within the agency
             responsible for conducting tax crime investigations will vary depending on other factors,
             such as the strategic priorities and the organisational structure.
                    85. Recognising these circumstances, the important resources for agencies fighting tax
             crimes include:
             Financial resources
                    86. This means having the budget and funding to pay for the needs of the agency. The
             average budget over 2015 and 2016 for surveyed jurisdictions for which data was available
             was as follows:

             dependent on meeting defined performance measures, even where performance targets
             had been agreed. From the survey, having pre-defined performance targets was uncommon.
             In eight jurisdictions responding to the survey, performance targets had been identified,
             which included a minimum number of concluded investigations, number or percentage
             of investigations leading to prosecution, surplus earning, target time to complete an
             investigation, and revenue collection target.

             the tax crime investigation function, as follows.

                  90. Having the necessary human resources also includes ensuring that staff have the
          appropriate skills and knowledge to conduct complex financial investigations. This includes
          two aspects: having staff with expertise in all relevant fields; and providing ongoing training
          on emerging risks, investigative tools and skills.
                  91. The need to ensure that the agency has the necessary expertise in all relevant fields
          reflects the fact that financial crime investigations demand specialist knowledge and know-
          how. All financial investigators should have a certain basic level of financial knowledge and
          skills such as practical investigation techniques, case management and intelligence collection.
          In addition, more specialised financial investigators will be needed, such as accountants,
          asset recovery specialists, cyber experts and forensic experts. A range of these skills may be
          needed to investigate one case, and having the range of skills available is therefore important.

             Training
                    92. Should be continuous and available for all staff at every level of experience and
             should include areas such as legal knowledge, emerging risks, investigative techniques,
             interview techniques, using and leveraging technology solutions, management skills, and
             working in cross-agency and international investigations. Where possible, training should
             include practical training drawn from real-life cases, as well as incorporating joint training
             sessions with investigators, prosecutors, tax authorities and other relevant stakeholders
             to create greater awareness of the possibilities for inter-agency co-operation. Undertaking
             international training can also be beneficial in sharing different approaches and creating a
             network of professionals that can enhance international co-operation.
             Infrastructure resources
                    93. This means having physical tools required to conduct tax crime investigations, such
             as forensic tools, administrative equipment including for enforcement actions, the ability to
             securely handle evidence, and effective communication platforms.
             Organisational resources
                    94. This means having the organisational and strategic resources to conduct the work
             and use the resources efficiently, as well as a network of inter-agency relationships.
             Data and technology resources
                    95. This means having access to relevant data and intelligence, as well as the hardware
             and software to analyse it. In terms of the data and intelligence required, this should
             include access to tax and other revenue information, bank account information, real estate
             information and commercial and company information. In terms of the technology resources,
             this includes computers, IT systems, smartphones, and data storage systems as well as the
             analytical tools to establish links, patterns and risks amongst different sources of data (both
             structured and unstructured data). Increasingly, law enforcement agencies need to have
             the skills and tools to conduct investigations in response to the increasing digitalisation
             and globalisation of criminal activity and it is likely that information and data analytics
             will become even more important, and access to a wider range of digital information and
             analytical tools will be needed. The survey shows that responding jurisdictions have access
             to the following databases. Note that not all such databases exist in each jurisdiction. The
             below is intended to describe the current approaches taken by different jurisdictions, which
             depend on the organisational structure and availability and sensitivity of certain data, and
             without reaching a conclusion as to the effectiveness of such forms of access.

                      Principle 7: Make Tax Crimes a Predicate Offence
                                             for Money Laundering
            Introduction
                  96. The FATF Recommendations provide: “…Jurisdictions should apply the crime
             of money laundering to all serious offences, with a view to including the widest range of
             predicate offences” (Recommendation 3).
                  97.    Predicate offences are specified types of criminal activity that give rise to funds
             or assets. Those funds / assets may then be “laundered” to obscure the illegal source. For
             example, the predicate offence of drug trafficking can generate revenue, and through
             one of the basic steps of placement, layering and integration, conceal the illegal source
             of the funds, allowing the drug trafficker to use the funds without generating suspicion
             of criminal activity.1
                  98. The designation of certain crimes as predicate offences means that a person can
             be charged with the offence of money laundering as well as with the predicate offence itself.
                  99. During the latest revision of the FATF Recommendations in 2012, “tax crimes
             (related to direct and indirect taxes)” were separately identified in the existing list of specific
             categories of offences that should be predicate offences for money laundering.2
                 100. Including tax crimes as a predicate offence for money laundering is important
            because it means that:
                      ●● A  person that has committed money laundering can also be charged with the
                         underling predicate offence. This may allow the authorities greater scope to
                         secure a conviction and / or to impose greater penalties. In practice, whether
                         the investigation or prosecution of one or both offences are pursued will
                         depend on the case and factors such as the nature of the evidence and the
                         elements of the offence which must be proven.
                      ●● Financial institutions and other designated professionals and reporting entities are
                         required to file STRs, which report suspicions that a client’s funds are the proceeds
                         of a criminal activity, including money laundering as well as predicate offences.
                         As such, STRs can include suspicions of where a client’s funds are the proceeds
                         of tax crimes. This can provide greater intelligence from the private sector to the
                         government authorities. In order for this to be more effective, awareness of the
                         risks and indicators is needed amongst the relevant reporting entities of funds
                         being the proceeds of tax crimes. These reports are filed with the FIU.
                      ●● STRs  are analysed by the FIU and where relevant intelligence is disseminated
                         to the domestic competent authorities responsible for investigating and / or
                         prosecuting the relevant predicate offence. As such, it is possible for STRs to
                         be shared by the FIU with the authority responsible for investigating and / or
                         prosecuting tax crimes.3 (See also Principle 8).

                     ●●  The mechanisms for international co-operation under the FATF Recommendations
                         apply as between authorities that have responsibility for investigating and / or
                         prosecuting money laundering and predicate offences. Where tax crimes are
                         included as predicate offences, those avenues for international co-operation are
                         expanded to include authorities responsible for investigating and / or prosecuting
                         tax crimes. This includes direct exchange of information and mutual legal assistance,
                         both between tax investigatory and / or prosecution authorities and between tax
                         and non-tax investigatory / prosecution authorities (see also principle 9).
                101. In practice, most jurisdictions surveyed have noted that the inclusion of tax
          crimes as a predicate offence has had a practical and positive impact on their work. Based
          on survey data, the most reported impact of tax crimes being a predicate offence was better
          inter-agency co-operation. This included increased ability to work with other agencies
          on particular cases and more generally on strategic and policy matters, more awareness
          amongst other law enforcement, intelligence agencies and amongst the private sector of
          the possibility of tax crimes occurring, and better avenues for communication with other
          agencies. Many jurisdictions also reported having better access to information (particularly
          from the FIU and increased STRs). Some jurisdictions also reported that prosecutions were
          easier to undertake and that there was an increase in prosecutions. One jurisdiction noted
          the deterrent effect on would-be offenders.
                102. Although “tax crimes” is not defined, the FATF Interpretive Note to Recommendation
          3 states that jurisdictions are required to apply the crime of money laundering to all serious
          offences, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offences. Each jurisdiction
          must determine how the requirement will be implemented in their domestic law, including
          how it will define the offence and the elements of those offences that make them serious
          offences.
                103. There are different ways for jurisdictions to designate tax crimes as predicate
          offences for money laundering. For example, jurisdictions may:
                        ●● use an inclusive approach and identify all criminal offences as predicate offences;
                        ●● use  a threshold approach and designate as a predicate offence all offences
                           meeting a certain threshold, such as being punishable by one year imprisonment
                           or more, or offences designated in a category of “serious offences;” or
                        ●● use  a list approach and create an explicit list of offences that are predicate
                           offences
                104. From the survey respondents, jurisdictions are using the following approaches
          in practice:4

                  105. Seven jurisdictions reported using the “threshold approach” (alone or as part of
            a combination approach). Six of these defined the threshold as offences punishable by a
            prison term exceeding a certain time (ranging from six months to four years) and the other
            defined the threshold as those offences prosecuted by indictment.
                  106. Surveyed jurisdictions also reported on whether the tax crimes included as a
            predicate offence extended to tax crimes committed in a foreign jurisdiction, as required
            by the FATF Recommendations, and 19 of the 31 jurisdictions confirmed this was the case.
            An additional four jurisdictions required there to be some link to the domestic jurisdiction
            (namely, that the predicate offence results in a criminal offence being committed in the
            domestic jurisdiction, that the conduct would also qualify as a crime in the domestic
            jurisdiction, if at least one part of the conduct was committed in the domestic jurisdiction,
            or only to the extent the predicate offence was conducted within the European Union).

                                        Inter-Agency Co-Operation
             Introduction
                  107. Combating financial crimes comprises a number of key stages, including the
             prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of offences, and the recovery of
             the proceeds of crime. Depending upon the circumstances, this can involve a number of
             government agencies, including the tax administration, the customs administration, financial
             regulators, AML authorities including the FIU, the police and specialised law enforcement
             agencies, anti-corruption authorities and the public prosecutor’s office.
                  108. Furthermore, the various agencies may each have unique information or
             investigative and enforcement powers that can enhance another agency’s investigation
             of a particular crime. This makes co-operation amongst the relevant agencies particularly
             important and beneficial. This includes information sharing, as well as other forms of co-
             operation. The forms of co-operation below can also be used in parallel with each other, and
             one does not necessarily exclude the other. In order to make the best use of co-operation,
             it will be particularly helpful if the relevant agencies have identifiable contact points for
             information sharing and co-operation, as well as a clear understanding of the types of
             information and powers the other agencies possess.
                  109. Any such co-operation is subject to the domestic law and the need to prevent
             any abuse of powers, which is further discussed below. In addition, depending on the
             organisational structure in place in a jurisdiction, and which agency has responsibility for
             investigating tax crimes (see principle 5 for more details), different forms of co-operation
             may be appropriate.
             Information sharing
                  110. A common form of co-operation is information sharing. In the course of their
             activities, different government agencies collect and hold information on individuals,
             corporations and transactions which may be directly relevant to the activities of other
             agencies in combating financial crime.
                  111. Effective information sharing can be used to improve the prevention and detection
             of crimes, identify evidence which may lead to new investigations, and support ongoing
             investigations. In some cases information may be of a type that the receiving agency could
             not obtain directly, particularly where the information is of a specialist nature such as that
             held by the tax administration or FIU. In others, the ability to receive information from other
             agencies may reduce the duplication of work by different agencies, increasing the speed
             and reducing the cost of investigations, result in faster and more successful prosecutions,
             and increase the likelihood of the proceeds of crime being recovered.
                  112. In addition, sharing of information can be used to identify new angles to existing
             investigations, such as where an investigation into a tax offence reveals other criminal

          activity and money laundering. The use of information from different sources may increase
          officers’ understanding of an issue or of the activities of a suspect, possibly increasing the
          effectiveness of enquiries. Importantly, mechanisms for sharing information may be used
          to develop relationships between agencies, and key individuals in those agencies, which can
          be beneficial in developing new and enhanced forms of inter-agency co-operation.
          Legal gateways for information sharing
                113. In order for information to be shared, legal gateways must exist between the
          relevant agencies. Legal gateways for sharing information may take a number of forms,
          such as:
                        ●● Primary    legislation often provides the basic framework for co-operation.
                           This could be by explicitly requiring that an agency shares certain types of
                           information in specified circumstances, or by generally allowing information
                           sharing between agencies subject to limited exceptions.
                        ●● Where    permitted by law, agencies may enter into bilateral agreements or
                           ‘memoranda of understanding’, agreeing to share information where this is of
                           relevance to the other agency’s activities. These memoranda typically contain
                           details of the types of information that will be shared, the circumstances in
                           which sharing will take place and any restrictions on sharing information such
                           as that the information may only be used for specified purposes. Memoranda
                           may also include other terms agreed by the agencies, such as the format of
                           any request for information, details of competent officials authorised to deal
                           with requests, and agreed notice periods and time limits or a requirement
                           for the agency receiving information to provide feedback on the results of
                           investigations in which the information was used.
          Models of information sharing
                114. Generally, there are four different types of co-operation with respect to sharing
          information among different agencies:
                        ●● direct access to information contained in agency records or database. This can
                           include direct access to mass or bulk data or bulk for risk assessment as well
                           as specific access rights to a particular case record or file;
                        ●● an obligation to provide information automatically (i.e. at regular intervals) or
                           spontaneously (i.e. on the occasions when relevant information is identified),
                           normally where the categories of such information are pre-defined (sometimes
                           expressed as a ‘reporting obligation’);
                        ●● an ability, but not an obligation, to provide information spontaneously; and
                        ●● an obligation or ability to provide information but only in response to a specific
                           request which is made on a case-by-case basis.
          Forms of information sharing
                115. Different forms of information sharing may be particularly effective in different
          contexts. For example:
                        ●● Where information is suitable for using analytics and high-level risk assessment,
                           direct access, or automatic or spontaneous exchange could be most effective.
                           Operationally, this will be most effective if the types of information to be shared

                           are clearly defined and can be automated. It also can assist in the detection
                           of previously unknown criminal activity. Training on using the direct access,
                           as well as in greater protections to ensure confidentiality and data protection
                           may be relevant in this case.
                        ●● Discretionary   spontaneous sharing of information may be very effective
                           when there is a long-standing co-operative relationship between the agencies
                           involved, and there is a clear understanding of what information may be
                           useful in the activities of the recipient agency. Like direct access or automatic
                           exchange, this can assist in proactively alerting an agency to previously
                           unknown criminal activity. This should at a minimum include spontaneous
                           sharing of information by tax authorities with the appropriate domestic law
                           enforcement authorities of suspicions of serious crimes, including foreign
                           bribery, money laundering and terrorism financing.1
                        ●● Where the information needed is very specific or needs to be in a certain form,
                           information on request or direct access to a specific case record may be most
                           suitable. This is likely to be most relevant when an investigation is relatively
                           well advanced and the investigating agency already has sufficient information
                           to provide the basis of the request.
                  116. Given the range of investigative techniques available throughout the course of
             an investigation, it may be most effective if the broadest possible range of information
             sharing methods is available, both from and to the agency investigating tax crimes. However,
             whichever types of information sharing are used, it is important to protect the confidentiality
             of information and the integrity of work carried out by other agencies, and in accordance
             with domestic law. This would likely include setting clear parameters relating to which
             people can access the information and for what purpose, as well as having governance
             mechanisms in place to ensure information is used appropriately.
             Other forms of co-operation
                  117. In addition to information sharing, there is a range of other forms of co-operation
             being used by law enforcement authorities. Examples include the following.
             Joint investigation teams
                  118. These enable agencies with a common interest to work together in an investigation.
             In addition to sharing information, this enables an investigation team to draw on a wider
             range of skills and experience from investigators with different backgrounds and training.
             Joint investigations may avoid duplication arising from parallel investigations, and increase
             efficiency by enabling officials from each agency to focus on different aspects of an
             investigation, depending upon their experience and legal powers. In some cases, gateways
             for sharing information are wider when agencies are engaged in a joint investigation than
             they would be in other circumstances.
             Inter-agency centres of intelligence
                  119. These are typically established to centralise processes for information gathering
             and analysis for a number of agencies. Inter-agency centres may be established to focus
             on operational information (case-specific information and investigations) or strategic
             information (broader assessment of risks and threats, focusing on a specific geographic area
             or type of criminal activity, or having a wider role in information sharing). These centres

          conduct analysis based on primary research as well as information obtained by participating
          agencies. By centralising these activities, officials can obtain experience of particular legal
          and practical issues, and specialised systems can be developed which can increase their
          effectiveness. Cost savings may also be achieved, as the expense of collecting, processing
          and analysing data can be shared between participating agencies.
          Secondments and co-location of personnel
                120. This is an effective way of enabling skills to be transferred while allowing
          personnel to build contacts with their counterparts in another agency. Seconded officials
          share their skills, experience and specialist knowledge while participating directly in the
          work of the host agency. Jurisdictions report that arrangements to co-locate and second
          staff have wider benefits for inter-agency co-operation, including encouraging officials to
          recognise opportunities for co-operation, more proactive engagement with counterparts
          from other agencies, improving the effectiveness of co-operation that does take place, and
          increasing the speed and efficiency of information sharing.
          Other models
                121. Other strategies include the use of shared databases, dissemination of strategic
          intelligence products such as newsletters and intelligence briefs, joint committees to co-ordinate
          policy in areas of shared responsibility, and inter-agency meetings and training sessions to
          share information on trends in financial crime, guidance on investigative techniques and
          best practice in managing cases.
                122. In the context of the above, particular areas where inter-agency co-operation has
          been successful in some jurisdictions include:
                        ●● Granting the tax administration access to STRs (or “suspicious activity reports”)2
                        ●● Granting      the FIU access to certain information held by the tax administration
                        ●● Having     a co-ordinated strategy for analysing and responding to STRs
                        ●● Putting     obligations on tax officials to report suspicions of non-tax crimes to
                           the police or public prosecutor
                        ●● The    use of multi-agency task forces to combat financial crimes
                        ●● Putting     in place a centralised structure for inter-agency co-operation
                        ●● Developing       a co-ordinated approach to recovering the proceeds of crime
                        ●● Co-operation       with the private sector in the fight against tax crime.

            Introduction
                   124. Tax crimes very frequently have an international dimension, for instance because
            a foreign jurisdiction was used to hide assets or income, or because the proceeds from illicit
            transactions are kept abroad, without being declared to tax authorities. Because criminal
            activity can cross international borders, but investigation agencies have powers which
            are limited by jurisdictional boundaries, co-operation amongst investigation agencies is
            necessary.
                   125. International co-operation can take a number of forms including information
            sharing; service of documents; obtaining evidence; facilitating the taking of testimony from
            witnesses; transferring persons for questioning; executing freezing and seizing orders;
            and joint investigation. In order for such co-operation to take place, there should be a legal
            agreement setting out the terms and procedural requirements. These agreements can be
            information sharing agreements (such as TIEAs), agreements for exchange of information
            and administrative assistance, bilateral tax treaties and other instruments (such as the
            multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters) as well as
            agreements for co-operation in using investigative and coercive powers (such as MLATs).
            These agreements should authorise international co-operation for crimes including tax
            crimes.
                   126. The use of exchange of information and MLATs in 2015 amongst survey respondent
            was as follows. It is noted that in some cases, data was not broken down to exclude non-tax
            crime requests, and this is noted and shown in italics where relevant.1

                127. With a view to having a successful holistic approach to fighting tax crime, it is
          of key importance that jurisdictions have a far-reaching and functioning international co-
          operation network. This network should be characterised by the following features:
                        ●● Be  in place with a wide geographical coverage of other jurisdictions;
                        ●● Cover   a wide range of types of assistance, including exchange of information
                           and other forms of assistance in investigation and enforcement;2
                        ●● Be supported by a domestic legal framework that allows the sharing of information
                           both sent and received under international legal instruments with all relevant
                           domestic criminal investigation, intelligence and enforcement agencies, where
                           appropriate (i.e. tax authorities, criminal investigation authorities, FIUs, AML
                           authorities); and
                        ●● Be  given effect in practice, including having a clear operational framework
                           for international co-operation. This should include having dedicated and
                           identified contact points that foreign agencies can contact in case of a request
                           for assistance, sufficient resources to fulfil requests for assistance, as well as
                           training and awareness for domestic investigation agencies as to the availability
                           of international co-operation and how to make effective requests.
                128. Although the legal gateways are in place in many cases, practical obstacles can
          have a significant impact on effective international co-operation. This includes delays caused
          by a lack of clear communication channels, confusion about the organisational structure or
          mandate in the counterpart and therefore delays in identifying the correct agency to whom
          to address the request, and practical communication difficulties including language or lack of
          clarity in the presentation of the facts of the request. Results from the survey conducted for
          this guide also showed that jurisdictions may not keep detailed data to monitor the use or
          impact of the international co-operation tools, which may contribute to a lack of awareness
          or reduced profile of these tools.

                                  Principle 10: Protect Suspects’ Rights
             Introduction
                  129. Persons subject to a criminal tax investigation should be able to rely on certain
             procedural and fundamental rights, which are afforded to everyone suspected or accused
             of a criminal act, including tax crime.
                  130. The United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out the
             fundamental human rights which are to be universally protected.1 Similar rights and
             guidelines can for instance be found in the European Convention on Human Rights and the
             African Commission on Human & Peoples’ Rights, Principles and Guidelines on the Right
             to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa.2 These rights may be given effect in domestic
             law by being enshrined in a jurisdiction’s constitution or bill of rights, or within criminal
             procedure law.3
                  131. In particular, taxpayers suspected or accused of committing a tax crime should
             be able to rely on the following rights:
                         ●● The  right to a presumption of innocence;
                         ●● The  right to be advised of their rights;
                         ●● The  right to be advised of the particulars of what one is accused of;
                         ●● The  right to remain silent;
                         ●● The  right to access and consult a lawyer and entitlement to free legal advice;
                         ●● The  right to interpretation and translation;
                         ●● The  right to access documents and case material, also known as a right to full
                            disclosure;
                         ●● The  right to a speedy trial; and
                         ●● The  right to protection from double jeopardy (ne bis in idem).
                  132. The criminal tax investigation agency needs to be aware of these fundamental
             rights since failure to do so will not only negatively impact on the rights of an individual,
             but may have an adverse effect on an investigation and prosecution of a tax crime, for
             example, where evidence obtained becomes inadmissible if the individual’s rights were
             violated.
                  133. In particular, as there are instances where a criminal investigation may have
             originated as an ordinary civil examination or audit procedure, jurisdictions should have
             safeguards to ensure that the rights of an accused are protected when there is a change
             from administrative to criminal law. For example, in a civil examination, the taxpayer
             has an obligation to provide information to the tax administration; however in a criminal
             investigation, the suspect may have the right to remain silent. This issue is of particular
             importance for tax administrations which direct and conduct criminal investigations
             within the same organisational structure as the civil tax (audit) function, referred to as
             organisational Model 1 in principle 5 above.

                134. The line that separates a civil tax matter to the criminal tax matter can require
          judgement and may be unclear. Based on the survey, most jurisdictions reported that a
          civil investigation becomes a criminal investigation when there is a reasonable suspicion
          that a crime had been committed, or where the facts indicate that a crime may have been
          committed. A smaller number of jurisdictions use an objective marker to determine when
          a civil matter becomes a criminal investigation, and which is based on a threshold of the
          amount of tax evaded. Based on survey data, 11 jurisdictions reported that civil and criminal
          investigations cannot run in parallel, and in practice the civil / administrative tax audits
          would be suspended and the criminal investigation would take precedence. 19 jurisdictions
          reported the possibility for civil / administrative tax audits to be conducted in parallel with
          criminal investigations. Many of these added that there are safeguards to ensure that the
          rights of an accused are protected when there is a parallel civil and criminal investigation,
          such as ensuring the investigations are run independently.
                135. More detail on each of the rights of suspects is set out below.
                136. The right to a presumption of innocence: This is the principle that a person is
          considered innocent until proven guilty and it is a critical component of the criminal justice
          system. The presumption of innocence means the burden of proof is on the prosecution
          and not on the accused.
                137. As an example of how this can be implemented, the European Council recently
          adopted a directive to strengthen certain aspects of the presumption of innocence.4 This
          Directive requires member states to respect the following related obligations: “before the final
          judgement, suspects and accused persons should not to be presented as being guilty through
          the use of measures of physical restraint and the burden of proof is on the prosecution while
          any reasonable doubts as to the guilt should benefit the accused.”
                138. The right of the suspect or accused to be advised of their rights: This right places a duty
          on the investigating agency to advise a suspect or accused of their rights. In some jurisdictions,
          this obligation may be fulfilled by orally advising the person of their rights or in writing by
          issuing a “Letter of Rights”. These rights will generally include the right to remain silent, the
          right to be informed of the accusations against the person and the right to access a lawyer or
          in some circumstances the right to free legal advice. For example, in the United States this is
          known as a “Miranda Warning,” and many other jurisdictions have equivalents.5
                139. In practice, jurisdictions may administer these rights at different stages of an
          investigation. Some jurisdictions advise an accused of their rights at the commencement
          of any questioning, while others may do so when a person is arrested.
          The right to remain silent
                140. This is the right of an accused person to refuse to comment or provide answers
          when questioned by a criminal investigator. This right is recognised by most legal systems
          and protects an individual from self-incrimination. This right usually applies both prior to
          and during a trial.
          The right to be advised of the particulars of what one is accused of
                141. This right enables the accused to know the nature and substance of the allegations
          against them. This would generally include the elements of the offence, such as the essential
          aspects of the offence, details of the alleged conduct which led to the charge and in the case
          of a tax crime, the alleged damage to the state. Generally, the particulars must be provided
          to an accused prior to the accused entering a plea in court.

             The right to access and consult a lawyer and entitlement to free legal advice
                  142. Someone accused of having committed a tax crime must have the opportunity to
             seek legal advice. In addition, if the accused cannot afford legal advice or legal representation,
             then there may be a right to state-funded legal assistance. This fundamental right is essential
             to a fair legal system, given the potentially serious the consequences of a conviction.
                  143. The specific details of these rights vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Jurisdictions
             may have different practices with respect to when the right to seek legal advice becomes
             available. For example, in Canada the right extends to someone who has been detained or
             arrested. Jurisdictions will also have different approaches to the right to state-funded legal
             representation, which may be available only in specific circumstances such as where the
             accused meets certain financial criteria.
                  144. In Europe, under Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights
             provides that a person charged with a criminal offence has the right “to defend himself in
             person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to
             pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require” and this
             right may be applied both at the pre-trial stage and during the trial.
             The right to interpretation and translation
                  145. This right allows an accused to understand the information about the criminal
             proceedings in their own language. This ensures that language barriers are not a barrier
             to receiving a fair trial. The costs associated with these services are usually borne by the
             prosecuting authority.
                  146. Generally this right should apply to the questioning of the suspect or accused by
             a representative of the state authority, meetings between the prosecution and the accused
             and their lawyer, and during all court appearances and hearings.
                  147. For example, within the European Union, these rights extend to the translation
             of essential documents, including any decision depriving a person of his or her liberty, any
             charge or indictment and any judgment.
             The right to access documents and case material, also known as a right
             to full disclosure
                   148. This means that the accused has the right to know the details of the case which is
             argued against them, including the evidence held by the prosecutor. This allows the accused the
             opportunity to prepare a defence. This disclosure can also encourage the resolution of the case
             before going to a trial, such as encouraging an accused to confess to the crime and plead guilty.
                  149. The way jurisdictions implement this right will vary. In some jurisdictions there
             is a duty on the prosecutor to provide disclosure of all evidence to an accused person,
             including evidence that is favourable to the accused and evidence that is favourable to the
             prosecution. This may be subject to the prosecutor’s discretion with respect to timing and
             withholding information for valid reasons such as protection of an informant.
             The right to a speedy trial
                  150. This right should protect an accused person from undue delay in the resolution
             of a trial. This is because undue delay may:
                  ●● Prejudice   the accused from receiving a fair trial because evidence may become
                     unavailable or less reliable. For example, the memory of a witness may become weak
                     over time or witnesses may die.

               ●● If the accused is in prison pending the outcome of the trial, the accused may be
                  imprisoned for an unreasonably lengthy period if the accused is subsequently found
                  not guilty of the crime or the sentence imposed on the accused is less than the time
                  already served in prison.
                151. There may not be a definitive measurement of what is or is not a speedy trial and
          it may depend on several factors. In determining whether a breach of the right to a speedy
          trial has occurred, relevant factors may include:
               ●● The  length of the delay from the time the accused was charged with the crime until
                  the case is tried;
               ●● The reasons for the delay, including the complexity of completing the work necessary
                  for the case to tried, delays caused by the defence, delays caused by the prosecution,
                  institutional delays such as limited availability of trial dates in the relevant court,
                  and other reasons for delay;
               ●● Whether            the accused has waived any delay; and
               ●● The  prejudice to the accused in terms of a fair trial, such as the impact on the
                  availability or reliability of evidence.
          The right to protection from ne bis in idem (double jeopardy)
               152. This right protects an accused of being tried twice for the same crime, where
          the person has previously been found guilty and served their sentence or the person has
          been acquitted by a final judgement. This also protects an accused from being tried again
          for a less serious crime, where all of the elements of that less serious crime are subsumed
          in the elements of the more serious crime. However, this right does not prevent successive
          investigations where one investigation may not have resulted in criminal charges, but a
          subsequent investigation is commenced which is based on new evidence.
               153. The survey conducted shows that these rights are almost universally granted. The
          availability of these rights amongst surveyed jurisdictions is shows in the following chart.6

"353","                         List of competent authorities
                 with responsibility for investigating
                                                         tax offences
                 The below is intended to provide a brief overview of which agency has responsibility
            for investigating tax offences, including whether both national and sub-national agencies
            have competency in this area.
Jurisdiction               Agencies responsible for investigation of tax offences
Australia                  The investigation of tax offences is undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the
                           Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC).
                           The ATO is the Australian tax administrator who in addition to taking administrative or civil action in respect to tax offences, will
                           where appropriate, undertake (criminal) investigations into tax related offences.
                           The AFP is the primary agency which undertakes (criminal) investigations in respect to criminal tax offences.
                           The ACIC also ability to investigate suspected crimes through coercive powers, which allows it to conduct examinations, under which
                           witnesses are able to claim protection against other proceedings (in certain circumstances), as well as to require them to produce
                           documents or things relevant to an investigation.
Austria                    The Fiscal Law Enforcement Authority (located at the local tax offices) and the Tax Investigation Unit investigate tax crime on behalf
                           of the public prosecutor.
                           The Central Public Prosecutor’s Office for Combating Economic Crimes and Corruption (WKStA) was established with responsibility
                           for the investigation of fiscal law felonies concerning social fraud, companies with share capital exceeding EUR 5 000 000 or where
                           the damage exceeds EUR 5 000 000.
Brazil                     The tax administration of Brazil (Secretariat of the Federal Revenue of Brazil, or RFB) is responsible only for the administrative
                           investigation of possible tax crimes. Whenever sufficient evidence of possible crimes is found in such an investigation, RFB must
                           present the case to the criminal investigation authorities: either the Federal Prosecution Service (MPF) or the Department of Federal
                           Police (DPF). Tax crime investigations are usually conducted in joint procedures, involving police, prosecutors and RFB’s General
                           Co-ordination of Research and Investigation (COPEI).
                           The Federal Prosecution Service (MPF) is responsible for conducting criminal prosecutions and overseeing the activities of the police. It
                           comprises a number of branches: Federal, Labor, Military, and the Public Prosecution Offices in the States and Federal District.
                           The Department of Federal Police (DPF) is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and is responsible for preventing and
                           investigating offences that violate federal law. The role of the Federal Police is broad and encompasses tax crime investigations.
                           MPF and DPF can also start tax crime investigations of their own initiative, without a prior administrative investigation by RFB. At any
                           moment during the criminal investigation, they can request the support and co-operation of RFB.
                           At the State Level a similar structure exists. Each of the 26 States and the Federal District has their own tax administration authority,
                           the State Revenue Secretariat, responsible for the state taxes and for their administrative investigation. The Public Prosecution
                           Offices in each of Brazil’s States are responsible for conducting criminal prosecutions at the state level. These offices are led by the
                           State Attorney-Generals. The Special Action Group Against Organised Crime (GAECO) are special groups created by each state Public
                           Prosecutor’s Office to deal with complex cases involving organised crime, tax crimes and financial crimes.
                           The Civil Police is the state-level police with law enforcement duties that include investigating crimes committed in violation of
                           Brazilian criminal law. The Civil Police in the relevant state are mandated to investigate tax crimes only where it is an entirely local
                           matter which is not considered to be “against the political and social order or to the detriment of property, services and interests
                           of Brazil, its government entities and public companies, as well as other offences with interstate or international effects and those
                           requiring a uniform national approach”. In practice, the Civil Police commonly conducts tax crime investigations in conjunction
                           with their investigation into predicate offences. If it becomes evident that international or inter-state elements are involved, the
                           investigation is passed from the Civil Police to the DPF.
                                                                                                                                                                    73

   Jurisdiction             Agencies responsible for investigation of tax offences
   Canada                   The Canada Revenue Agency has the responsibility for investigating tax offences in Canada under section 239 of the Income Tax Act,
                            327 of the Excise Tax Act and section 380 of the Criminal Code.
                            The Criminal Investigations Program (CIP) is divided between a national Headquarters function that is located in the International,
                            Large Business and Investigations Branch (ILBIB) and six Tax Services Offices (TSO) located across the jurisdiction that conduct the
                            tax investigations.
                            The Criminal Investigations Directorate at headquarters provides functional leadership and program direction to the TSOs across
                            Canada. It provides policies, procedures along with technical and legal guidance on the development of investigations of violations
                            of the Excise Tax Act, in particular Part IX (Goods and Services Tax) and the Income Tax Act. Specifically, the Criminal Investigations
                            Directorate provides professional and responsive support in the areas of technical assistance, training, quality assurance, policy and

                            The TSOs conduct the criminal investigations. Their work involves the planning, examination and investigation of the financial affairs

   Czech Republic           Police of Czech Republic (abbr. PoCR) is responsible for detection and investigation of criminal deeds (in contrast to tax administration
                            which is responsible for assessment and collection of taxes). The police, the prosecution and the courts are authorized to use state
                            power to carry out proceedings enabling them to gather evidence valid before the criminal court. Other government institutions provide
                            impulses for investigations and criminal proceedings of police. Police criminal investigation is carried out under the prosecution’s
                            oversight. If there is enough evidence gathered according to the prosecution case is brought before the criminal court.
                            Within the police there are special units for financial crime investigation. Investigation of corruption and severe financial and
                            organized crime is centralized to two police departments responsible for all jurisdiction. In the organizational structure of the Police
                            of the Czech Republic, the National Organized Crime Agency of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service is dealt with tax crimes
                            at the national level, in particular the Tax Crime Division in the Financial Crime Command. At the regional level operate the economic
                            crime divisions of the individual regional directorates of the Police of the Czech Republic, at the level of the districts of the economic
                            criminality departments of the Regional Offices of the Police of the Czech Republic.
                            Prosecution (abbr. SPPO) is responsible for preparation of a criminal case in co-operation with the police (see above). It is up to the
                            prosecution to decide whether enough evidence was gathered to submit the case before the court. The prosecution is also obliged to
                            carry out oversight over the police guaranteeing that evidence was gathered in a manner which is according to the law. The prosecution
                            or the criminal court has the right to ask tax authorities for information gathered in the process of the tax administration, i.e. under the
                            tax secrecy, if a tax crime is being investigated. There is no special tax crime prosecutor’s office as a part of the tax administration.
   Denmark                  Only the police have the powers to investigate tax offences. Severe tax offences are investigated by a special police force (SØIK).
                            However, if the tax offenses are undisguised through tax auditing, and no police investigations are required, the tax department has
                            the power to fine the lawbreakers. This applies to small cases where tax evasion with intent are under 250,000 DKK or in all cases
                            “with gross negligence.”

 Jurisdiction                Agencies responsible for investigation of tax offences
 Germany                     Tax crimes and tax-related administrative offences constitute substantive criminal law, the enforcement of which is the responsibility
                             of the highest revenue authorities of the Länder (Articles 83 and 84 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz)). Subject-matter responsibility
                             lies with the revenue authorities administering the tax concerned.
                             Within the revenue administration, special units in charge of administrative fines and criminal matters (known in German as Bußgeld-
                             und Strafsachenstellen) are responsible for investigating tax crimes and tax-related administrative offences (section 385 et seqq.
                             of the Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung)). When the revenue authorities conduct investigations into a tax crime, they assume the
                             function of the public prosecutor’s office, within the limits of their statutory powers. This is only the case, however, if the crime under
                             investigation constitutes exclusively a tax crime. Moreover, the revenue authority may hand the criminal matter over to the public
                             prosecutor’s office; equally, the public prosecutor’s office may take over the criminal matter at any time.
                             The prosecution and punishment of tax-related administrative offences and tax crimes is the responsibility of the tax investigation
                             units located in the Länder. The role of the tax investigation service is laid down in sections 208 and 404 of the Fiscal Code.
                             Under section 208 subsection (1) of the Fiscal Code, the tax investigation service (customs investigation service) is charged with
                             1. investigating tax crimes and tax-related administrative offences,
                             2. determining the tax bases in the cases named in number 1 above,
                             3. detecting and investigating unknown tax cases.
                             Under section 404 of the Fiscal Code, the customs investigations offices and the tax investigation units of the Länder revenue
                             authorities as well as their officials have, with respect to criminal proceedings for tax crimes, the same rights and obligations as the
                             police authorities and officers under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung). This means that the
                             customs investigation offices and the tax investigation units of the Länder revenue authorities may order confiscations, emergency
                             sales, searches, inspections and other measures in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure that apply
                             to the public prosecutor’s offices’ investigators; they are also authorized to examine the papers of those affected by the search
                             (section 110 subsection (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure). In other words, their officials may act as investigators of the public
                             prosecutor’s office.
 Greece                      Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR) is responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of tax and other
                             financial crimes. It includes the General Directorate of Tax Administration (tax administration) and the General Directorate of
                             Customs and Excise (customs administration). The Directorate for Planning and for Evaluation of Audits and Investigations (DIPAEE)
                             and the Services for Investigations and for Safeguarding of Public Revenue (YEDDE) are also part of the IAPR.
                             The mission of Financial Police Division (FPD) is the prevention, investigation and combating of financial crimes, committed against
                             the interests of the public sector and the national economy, especially, those showing characteristics of organized crime, undeclared
                             or uninsured labour and tax evasion, even in cases that are not criminal offences.
                             The Public prosecutors and the Financial Crime Prosecutor are the ones who initiate the criminal prosecution for tax offences after
                             the filing of criminal reports by the Tax Administration Officers.

                             is related to the crimes of money laundering and terrorist financing and the source of funds investigation. Tax crimes are a predicate
                             offence to money laundering and in this context the FIU conducts criminal investigation based on tax crimes.
 Iceland                     The Directorate of Tax Investigations (the DTI) in Iceland investigates violations of tax law and laws regarding other duties levied by
                             the Directorate of Internal Revenue (the DIR) or with the enforcement of which the DIR is entrusted.
                             In addition, the DTI investigates violations of the Accounting Act and the Financial Statements Act. Taxes or duties levied by other
                             authorities than the DIR thus fall outside the scope of activity of the DTI.
                             There are no sub-national agencies with competency in this area.
 Indonesia                   In Indonesia, Directorate General of Taxes (DGT), under Ministry of Finance, is responsible for collecting tax, administering tax
                             affairs, and upholding the law in tax offences. DGT has a unit called Directorate of Law Enforcement designated specifically in
                             dealing with tax offences. Three key roles of Directorate of Law Enforcement Administration are tax crime investigation, managing
                             tax crime investigators throughout the nation, and providing supporting functions such as Digital Forensic and maintaining tax crime
                             information databases. It was established in 2007.
                             As of March 2016, a new unit was established for intelligence purposes. Included in that unit is the special unit for tax crime
                             indication analysis. Before a taxpayer is being escalated to a tax crime investigation, the unit would run some background checking
                             and data verification, in order to make sure that the indication leads to a tax crime being committed.
 Italy                       The Agenzia delle Entrate carries out the strategic functions of tax collection, assessment and investigation aimed at countering
                             tax evasion, in relation to direct taxes and value added tax. In the course of undertaking these activities, if tax auditors uncover
                             indications of possible tax crimes, they must report them to the public prosecutor.
                             The public prosecutor may then start an investigation with the aid of the judicial police. If tax auditors uncover indications of
                             suspicious financial operations, they must report this to the Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF).
                             According to the Italian Criminal Law, the Guardia di Finanza is tasked with prevention, detection, and investigation of all kinds of tax
                             crime violations, together with co-operation with the prosecutorial authorities. The Guardia di Finanza is the only organisation in Italy
                             to take the role of both judicial police and tax police enabling it to conduct investigations of tax crimes using both judicial and civil
                             powers.

 Jurisdiction                Agencies responsible for investigation of tax offences
 Slovenia                    Key agencies responsible for investigation of criminal offences in the field of taxes in Slovenia are the Ministry of the Interior, Police
                             and the Office of the State Prosecutor General of the Republic of Slovenia, Specialised State Prosecutor`s Office (SSPO).
                             The Financial Administration of Republic of Slovenia (FARS) is responsible for investigations of administrative tax offences.
 South Africa                The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is legally mandated to conduct criminal investigations into all criminal offences created
                             under the Tax Administration Act and applies to all tax Acts whether indirect or direct taxes, excluding offences under the Customs
                             and Excise Act.
                             The National Agency responsible for combating all crime in general is the South African Police Service (SAPS). It has the legal
                             competency (mandate) to investigate all crimes in terms of the legal conventions which recognises unlawful conduct as an offence
                             including tax offences created under the tax Acts.
                             The SARS is the only authority assigned the legal mandate to officially lay a criminal complaint with the SAPS in respect of a Serious
                             Tax Offence (STO).
 Spain                       One of the functions of the Agencia Tributaria (AEAT) is to detect and investigate tax crimes and money laundering, whenever a tax
                             crime is the predicate offence. Tax officers carry out enquiries aimed at checking the tax position of the examined person. At a certain
                             point, when findings offer sufficient grounds, the cases are referred to the public prosecutor or directly to the courts.
                             In this second stage the investigation is completed by an examining judge. His or her final decision will be either that the case should
                             go for trial (presided over by a different judge or a panel of judges) or, otherwise, waive criminal charges.
                             In terms of direct taxes, there is no strict rule of assigning cases that might develop into tax crimes investigations to specialised
                             units in preference to other units or teams. However, specialisation of tax auditing units and the growing weight of tax investigations
                             has led to a situation where files that have the potential to become tax crime investigations are predominantly handled by some
                             specific units distributed throughout the jurisdiction. Judges in charge of a criminal investigation can request the Agencia Tributaria
                             to assist them with the investigation, contributing their specialist skills, knowledge and experience.
 Sweden                      The Swedish Economic Crime Authority (SECA) is a national prosecuting authority where prosecutors, police officers, economic
                             auditors and other experts work together in investigation teams, co-operating with tax fraud investigators at the Tax Fraud
                             Investigation Unit (TFIU) within the Swedish Tax Agency (STA). The main duties of the tax fraud investigators are to investigate tax
                             fraud following the instruction of the prosecutors.
 Switzerland                 In respect of direct tax, the responsibility lies with different agencies depending on whether the issue is tax evasion or tax fraud.
                             For tax evasion, the Cantonal tax authorities have responsibility for investigation and penal decisions. The Federal tax administration,
                             division for penal affairs and investigations, (“DPAI”) conducts investigations exceptionally in cases of heavy tax evasion and/or tax
                             fraud, however the penal decisions remain with cantonal tax administration.
                             For tax fraud, the Cantonal prosecutor is responsible.
                             In respect of indirect taxes, the Federal tax administration (DPAI) is responsible for investigation and penal decisions.
 United Kingdom              Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) is the United Kingdom’s tax, payments and customs authority.
                             HMRC is responsible for investigating crime involving the taxes, duties and other regimes it is responsible for. Within HMRC the
                             Fraud Investigation Service is the directorate that investigates criminal offences.
 United States               The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the sole agency responsible for federal tax administration. The Internal Revenue Service –
                             Criminal Investigation (IRS – CI) is the unit within the IRS that has statutory authority to investigate criminal violations of the Internal
                             Revenue Code.
                             In the United States, states that have state income tax have their own state tax authority that handles the respective state’s tax
                             administration. Data from the state tax authority were excluded from this report.

                                  Abstract
                                  Illicit financial flows (IFFs) connected with corruption, crime, and tax evasion are an issue
                                  of increasing concern. A target to reduce IFFs is included in the Sustainable Development
                                  Goals (SDGs). However, there is not yet a clear consensus on how to define illicit financial
                                  flows, and even less on how to measure them. In particular, while tax fraud and evasion
                                  clearly fall within the definition “illicit,” several arguments have been put forward for
                                  widening the term to also include legal behaviour which reduces tax payments. Rationales for
                                  this include the dictionary definition of the word “illicit” and the existence of enforcement
                                  uncertainty. One of the most practically compelling arguments has been a belief that there
                                  is a large “grey zone” reflecting an absence of clear defining lines between legal tax planning
                                  and tax evasion. This is often linked to the idea that transfer pricing and trade misinvoicing are
                                  areas of overlapping practice where major multinational companies engage in illicit financial
                                  flows. This paper explores the definitional questions and the estimates of trade misinvoicing
                                  to shed light on whether these behaviours and issues are the same or different. This paper
                                  argues that conflating legal and illegal behaviour under a single definition involves a loss of
                                  clarity and a risk of confusion.

"363","1. Introduction
Illicit financial flows (IFFs) have become an issue of increasing concern over the past 20
years, reflecting the damage wrought by kleptocracy, corruption, state capture, and organised
crime. Focusing on cross-border financial flows in particular highlights the role of
international banks, real estate, and corporate legal structures as vehicles for enabling ill-
gotten gains to be kept out of the reach of law enforcement.
The need for international cooperation to assist countries in tracking, tracing, and retrieving
assets across borders and to prevent impunity is increasingly well recognised. In 2000 the
UN General Assembly adopted the Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime,
including a commitment to criminalise the transfer, concealment, or disguise of assets of
illicit origin. In 2001 the Economic and Social Council agreed a resolution (2001/13) to
strengthen international cooperation in preventing and combating the transfer of funds of
illicit origin derived from acts of corruption, and in 2005 the UN Convention Against
Corruption (UNCAC) was adopted, including commitments on returning stolen assets. Since
the 9/11 attack in 2001 there has also been increasing in focus on financial networks that
support terrorism, as part of anti-money laundering controls.
Cross-border flows of money (or other assets) associated with crime, corruption, and tax
evasion are diverse, and by their nature hard to measure. However, large estimates of the
scale of illicit financial flows have played a key role in attracting attention and encouraged
political momentum. In 2004, Transparency International estimated that ten of the most
notoriously corrupt heads of state such as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, Sani Abacha
of Nigeria, and Suharto of Indonesia had together embezzled as much as US$60 billion from
their countries over the previous 20 years (Transparency International 2004). In the same
year Peter Reuter and Edwin Truman’s book “Chasing Dirty Money: The Fight Against
Money Laundering” reviewed emerging global estimates of the proceeds of crime and
corruption hidden through money laundering, and concluded they were likely to amount to
several hundreds of billions of dollars annually. In 2005 Raymond Baker published his
seminal book Capitalism's Achilles Heel: Dirty Money and How to Renew the Free Market System in
which he set out a global estimate of illicit financial flows in the hundreds of billions. He
went on to found the NGO Global Financial Integrity “with the aim of quantifying and
studying the flow of illegal money while promoting public policy solutions to curtail it,”
which has popularised figures in the order of one trillion dollars in annual illicit financial
flows from developing countries.1
In 2007 the government of Norway called on the World Bank to undertake a study of IFFs.
However, finding the concept too poorly understood to support quantification, the Bank
instead began by convening the first major international conference on the topic,
commissioning analytic contributions from diverse experts. This culminated in the
publication of Draining Development (World Bank, 2012). The book highlighted confusion and
contestation at every level of the issue; What does “IFFs” include? What do we know about

"364","them? How can they be measured? What damage do they do? How should they best be
addressed? Reuter, as editor, concluded that illicit financial flows are diverse and that we
know too little to take the reductionist approach of assuming that each dollar (whether
related to grand corruption, criminal enterprise, tax fraud and evasion, or evasion of capital
controls) does equal damage, or that they can all be dealt with through a single set of actions.
He argued that focusing on “black box” aggregate figures obscures the causes and
consequences of different streams and that “it is not clear how much effort should go
toward halting illicit flows, as opposed to dealing with the underlying phenomena.”
In 2015 IFFs was included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under target 16.4
to “significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of
stolen assets and combat all forms of organised crime.” It was agreed that this would be
measured using the indicator “total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows.”
The setting of this target and concrete indicator might perhaps suggest that in the ten years
since the first conference on illicit financial flows there must have been significant progress
in resolving the definitional questions, as well as breakthroughs in understanding and
measurement. In fact the state of knowledge and consensus has hardly advanced, and
debates are often confused. 2
1.1 Are tax avoidance and illicit financial flows the same or
different?
One question which needs to be answered in clarifying, defining, measuring, and effectively
tackling illicit financial flows is whether the concept should primarily concern financial flows
that relate to illegal actions, or whether a broader conception should be used that takes in tax
avoidance by multinational enterprises (so-called base erosion and profit shifting or
BEPS).
While these may seem like quite distinct areas of concern it is often that legal transactions
and practices that result low tax bills should also be included under the umbrella of illicit
financial flows.
One argument is that not only should corporate tax avoidance be included as part of IFFs,
but that it already is. In particular this view has been put forward by the NGOs the Tax
Justice Network (TJN) and the Global Alliance for Tax Justice (GATJ) and the Independent
Commission for Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT) in letters to the UN
Secretary General. They argue that this is a settled matter and “no amount of
reinterpretation or redefinition can raise any legitimate question over this point” (see Box 1).

"365","  Box 1: Letters to the Secretary General
  Global Alliance for Tax Justice: “The global agreement reached in the Sustainable Development
  Goals to seek to reduce illicit financial flows is an agreement that clearly covers tax avoidance by
  multinational companies. No amount of reinterpretation or redefinition can raise any legitimate
  question over this point. But the effort now to exclude tax avoidance retrospectively is well
  underway.”
  Independent Commission for Reform of International Corporate Taxation: We understand
  that some actors within the UN system are lobbying for a redefinition of the term ‘illicit financial
  flows’ in order retrospectively to exclude tax avoidance by multinational companies from the
  definition. Such a course of action represents a clear threat to the SDG contribution of domestic
  resource mobilization, and will also undermine confidence in the UN’s ability to deliver honestly on
  what member states have previously agreed upon.

Sometimes this argument is made “by the numbers”; it is often stated that tax related illicit
flows through trade misinvoicing attributed to multinational companies make up the largest
proportion of illicit financial flows and therefore must be core to the IFFs agenda.
This paper argues that combining legal and illegal activity into a vaguely defined composite
category is not something to do lightly, if the overall goal is to strengthen the rule of law,
democratic accountability, and the effectiveness of states. It sets out the arguments for and
against including BEPS within the definition of illicit financial flows and examines the
assumptions behind the methodologies used to calculate popular and influential measures of
trade misinvoicing which give rise to the “by the numbers” argument.

"366","           2. Illicit financial flows: definition debates
           The most common working definitions of illicit financial flows converge around the core
           concept of financial transfers across borders that are in some way related to illegal activity (see Table
           1).

Financing for Development (2017)              namely: i) illicit financial flows constitute money that is illegally earned,
                                              transferred or used and ii) that crosses borders.”
OECD (2014) Illicit Financial Flows           “There are various definitions of illicit financial flows, but essentially they are
from Developing Countries                     generated by methods, practices and crimes aiming to transfer financial capital
                                              out of a country in contravention of national or international laws.
United Nations (2016) Coherent                IFFs are defined broadly as all cross-border financial transfers, which
Policies for Combatting Illicit               contravene national or international laws.
Financial Flows
United Nations (2016) World                   “There is no agreed definition of the concept of illicit financial flows (IFFs),
Economic Situation and Prospects              but it is generally used to convey three different sources of IFFs: the proceeds
2016                                          of commercial tax evasion, revenues from criminal activities, and public
                                              corruption.”
World Bank (2016) The World Bank              “Generally refers to cross-border movement of capital associated with illegal
Group’s response to illicit financial         activity or more explicitly, money that is illegally earned, transferred or used
flows: a stocktaking                          that crosses borders.”
           This “narrow” definition of illicit financial flows covers a range of activities including hiding
           the proceeds of crime, drug trafficking, and embezzlement; channelling funds towards
           criminal destinations, such as bribery or terrorism; misreporting transactions in order to
           evade tariffs or taxes; and capital flight in disobedience with currency controls.
                                                                   4

Source: Forstater, M (2016) Illicit Flows and Trade Misinvoicing: Are we looking under the wrong lamppost?
While there is a fair degree of convergence between these definitions, there remains some
fuzziness. For example, the definition suggested in the OECD publication seems to focus
only on the illegality of the transfer, rather than the source or use of funds (although this
may be assuming predicate offenses which underpin the crime of money laundering). The
GFI definition refers to funds (i.e., money), while the OECD describes movement of financial
capital which could cover loans, equity, financial instruments, or possibly even physical assets
if used in the pursuit of future revenue. (In practice, however, GFI’s definition also includes
transfer of goods in the case of trade based money laundering.) 3
Beyond these detailed definitional questions, some actors propose a much wider
“normative” definition, which is not limited to financial or capital flows with a connection to
illegality, but includes activities which are deemed to be undesirable, immoral, or
“unacceptable to the public,” in particular focused on tax avoidance. This of course begs the
question who holds these morals or ethics, and whether they are universal and well defined.

                                          could be considered “illicit.”

        Several justifications have put forward for the wider approach:
             1. By etymology: One argument is that the dictionary definition of the word “illicit”
                 is inherently wider than the word illegal; relating to action that is morally wrong or
                 against societal norms and therefore, by definition, “illicit financial flows” must
                 address areas beyond illegality (Cobham, 2015).
                                                             6
"
"369","      2. By enforcement uncertainty: Financial flows related to illegal activities may go
           unchallenged, such as when the revenue agency lacks capacity or there is no political
           will to address the theft of state funds. Chowla and Falcao (2016) therefore rehearse
           the argument that legal non-compliance cannot be a clear dividing line, because
           uncovering financial flows which would be prevented if they were detected and
           challenged depends on the investigative and legal resources to do so.
      3. By legal grey area: A further argument is that there is a large grey zone in the area
           of tax avoidance reflecting an absence of clear legal defining lines between tax
           compliance and non-compliance, and therefore that the distinction between the two
           areas is arbitrary (Chowla and Falcao, 2016). The UN Human Right Council (2016)
           report refers to “legal loopholes” and other artificial arrangements, circumventing
           the “spirit of the law.”
      4. By consensus: A final argument, as put forward by the Tax Justice Network and
           Global Alliance for Tax Justice is that there is already global political agreement that
           a broad normative definition of illicit financial flows underpins the SDGs, and that
           focusing on the narrower law related definition would therefore be a clear
           subversion the existing global consensus about the meaning of IFFs.

2.1 Is there already consensus?
The meaning of novel policy terms, is of course, politically defined. It is entirely up to parties
to any international agreement to establish what they mean. Therefore the fourth argument
could trump all others. If the governments involved in developing the SDGs had reached
consensus on the meaning of “illicit financial flows” (or indeed “red flag financial flows” or
“harmful financial flows” or any other form of words they might have chosen to use) then
that would be the established definition. Alex Cobham (2017) argues that when SDG 16.4
was agreed, “there was no question that avoidance was included” and that there is “no
question that those signing up to the SDG agreement to include target 16.4, did so in the
belief that avoidance was included.”
                                                    7
"
"370","However there is no record of the architects of the SDGs in practice adopting such a
definition. Those that have reviewed the field such as The Interagency Taskforce on
Financing for Development state that there is “as yet no firm agreement on conceptual and
definitional issues related to the term IFFs” (Chowla & Falcao, 2016). The Report of the
High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post 2015 Agenda, which informed the
development of the SDGs, highlights both illicit financial flows and tax avoidance, however,
it does not elide the two; it describes illicit flows as money illegally taken out of developing
countries through money-laundering of bribes and stolen funds and to evade taxes, while
also covering tax avoidance in a separate paragraph.
Civil society organisations argued in the run up to the UNCTAD summit in 2016 that the
UN should adopt a normative definition of illicit financial flows (Declaration of Civil
Society, 2016), suggesting that this was not already the common accepted definition. The
Financial Transparency Coalition says that “different country and regional interpretations of
the term have made achieving political consensus at the global level challenging.” 4
If there is already a clear global consensus around the wider definition, it is a well-kept
secret.
2.2 Can the dictionary solve it?
Another argument is that the dictionary definition of the word “illicit” requires that a broad
approach which goes beyond illegality. For example the Oxford English Dictionary gives a
definition of “not authorized or allowed; improper, irregular; esp. not sanctioned by law,
rule, or custom; unlawful, forbidden.” Certainly in everyday speech a married person can
have an illicit affair. A person on a diet might eat an illicit candy bar. A Muslim can have an
illicit drink.
However this argument is trivial. The sense of the word “illicit” is that something is against
the rules in its relevant domain (and is therefore carried out clandestinely). In the domain of
determining whether the assets a person holds rightly belong to them, to someone else or to
the government the relevant domain is the law.
The fact that the term “illicit financial flows” in the SDGs is sandwiched between illicit arms
trade, theft of public assets and organised crime (indeed the phrase used is “reduce illicit
financial and arms flows”) suggests that the definition of “illicit” should be the same as in
these closely related domains. Illicit manufacturing and trafficking of firearms in the UN
Convention Against Organised Crime is defined in relation to being unauthorized by the
relevant states. Illicit enrichment (UNCAC Article 20) is where the assets of a public official
increase beyond what can be explained by their lawful income. Illicit origin of property (in
UNCAC Article 23) is referred to under “laundering proceeds of crime.” The illicit cigarette
trade is defined by the FATF as “the production, import, export, purchase, sale, or

"
"371","possession of tobacco goods which fail to comply with legislation.” All of these meanings
suggest that illicit in this context should be defined in relation to illegality.
A further clue in this direction come from the specific origin of the term. Raymond Baker,
founder of Global Financial Integrity, an organisation that has played a key role in coining
the term IFFs and promoting it onto the international agenda, describes its origins in “A
Brief Biography of Illicit Financial Flows” (GFI, 2015) as being more sophisticated than
“dirty money” but less legally demanding than “illegal”:
         “One of our early conversations surrounded the phrase dirty money.” We both felt
         that this was counterproductive. It made people cringe and shrink from the
         subject.…So what should we call these enormous sums of money shifting out of
         emerging market and developing countries? After considerable discussion we
         homed in on the wording “illicit financial flows.” This had a number of advantages.
         “Illicit” is a slightly less demanding word than illegal and would be a bit more
         palatable to lawyers. “Financial” makes it clear that we are talking about money
         more than about drugs or arms or contraband. And “flows” is perhaps the most
         important word, making it clear that what is being addressed has an origin and a
         path and a destination. The combination of the three words is obviously more
         sophisticated than “dirty money,” not nearly so off-putting, much more robust,
         appealing to economists, lawyers, and policymakers. So “illicit financial flows” it was
         and still is.”
2.3 Grey areas?
Chowla and Falcao (2016) rehearse the second argument, that sticking with the narrow
definition could mean that IFFs could only be counted if they had been discovered and ruled
against by a court or competent authority. This seems an overly narrow interpretation. The
fact that some individuals and businesses get away with hiding, misreporting, or obscuring
transactions in order to successfully evade a legal liability does not invalidate the conceptual
definition of illicit flows being linked to illegality. Indeed this same issue could be raised for
money laundering, drug trafficking, theft of public assets, and other core areas of illicit flows.
Thus we are left with argument three, that there are large areas where there is uncertainty
about the interpretation of the law or where there are “loopholes” which allow taxpayers to
get away with following the letter but not the spirit of the law, and that these should be
considered illicit. This is what is commonly termed “avoidance” (or aggressive avoidance, or
abuse).
However, there are important distinctions. Avoidance is often formally defined as practices
designed to gain a tax advantage by contravening the intention of the legislation. For
example the UK government says abusive tax avoidance is when “the course of action taken
by the taxpayer aims to achieve a favourable tax result that Parliament did not anticipate
when it introduced the tax rules in question and, critically, where that course of action
cannot reasonably be regarded as reasonable.” The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
characterises abusive tax avoidance transactions as those that “take a tax position that is not
                                                   9
"
"372","supported by tax law or manipulate the law in a way that is not consistent with the law’s
intent.” (Hoddes, 2016). In these and many other jurisdictions courts already seek to close
this down, giving effect to the “spirit of the law” through purposive interpretation and anti-
abuse rules, and revenue authorities can challenge unreasonable transfer prices and other
transactions through audit. Such avoidance can therefore be found to be unlawful (i.e.,
turned into “failed tax avoidance”), and as such might be included under a definition of illicit
on this basis, although it is not clandestine.
Other common conceptions of “avoidance” go beyond this. For example the European
Commission say avoidance is “taking advantage of the technicalities of a tax system or of
mismatches between two or more tax systems for the purpose of reducing tax liability.” 5
Devereux, Freedman and Vella (2012) argue that it is inconsistent with the rule of law to try
to invoke a further “spirit of the law” which is different from the interpretation of legislation
by the courts, or mechanisms such as General Anti-Abuse Rules (GAARs). Where a defect
(or “loophole”) in the legislation is found, or where there is a problem of misalignments
between the tax rules of different countries allowing taxpayers to arbitrage between them,
they argue the most efficient course of action is to revise the specific legislation or treaty to
close the loophole.
Many BEPS planning strategies such as strategic transfer pricing and use of debt, treaty
shopping and “hybrid mismatches” (such as the famous “Double Irish-Dutch Sandwich”)
fall into this category (although are called “tax avoidance” in everyday speech). They can
remain legal tax planning, unless rules and treaties are updated to prevent them. Changes to
laws and tax treaties can prevent certain actions which were previously allowed, but this does
not make them by definition “illicit.”
3. “Trade misinvoicing”: the meeting point between IFFs
and avoidance?
Beyond these conceptual distinctions, a practical argument is often made that there is a
major category of action which has been identified as both “illicit financial flows” and also as
“legal avoidance,” and therefore that the two areas cannot be separated. This category of
action is “trade misinvoicing.”
Trade misinvoicing is a form of customs and/or tax fraud involving exporters and importers
deliberately misreporting the value, quantity, or nature of goods or services in a commercial
transaction. Estimates of trade misinvoicing are closely linked the term “IFFs,” as both were
popularised by Global Financial Integrity (GFI).
GFI famously estimates that trade misinvoicing is the largest portion of illicit financial flows.
It uses a methodology based on adding up gaps and mismatches in trade data to estimate
5 European Commission Recommendation on aggressive tax planning, 6 December 2012: http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32012H0772&from=EN
                                                 10
"
"373","that misinvoicing drains $800 billion from developing countries annually (GFI, 2015). Their
work also inspired the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the African
Union to set up a High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa which estimated
that this practice, concentrated on a few commodities, is responsible for $50 billion of illicit
flows from Africa (HLP, 2015). These numbers played a key role in the arguments for IFFs
to be included the SDGs.
The same numbers are often used to represent both fraudulent trade misinvoicing (for the
purposes of smuggling, tax and tariff evasion, paying bribes and kick-backs, and to evade
capital controls) and strategic transfer pricing used for profit shifting by multinational
corporations. For example early NGO reports on corporate tax avoidance, such as Christian
Aid’s “Death and Taxes” (2008) and “False Profits” (2009), used measures based on these
misinvoicing estimates to assess the scale of corporate tax avoidance through “transfer
mispricing.” The High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows also explicitly conflates trade
misinvoicing and corporate tax avoidance, while others such as The Africa Progress Panel in
2013 simply confused them—suggesting that the gross amount of trade misinvoicing
estimated by GFI was a tax loss due to transfer pricing (Forstater, 2013).
This conflation can lead to circular arguments: for example the Financial Transparency
Coalition (2016), whose leading member is Global Financial Integrity, argues that “excluding
tax avoidance [from the definition of IFFs] would have detrimental consequences on
revenue mobilization,” citing the Human Rights Council on Illicit Financial Flows and
Human Rights (2016) which says that “tax-related illicit financial flows has the potential to
make the largest fiscal impact.” However the evidence that the Human Rights Council draws
on for this is GFI’s estimate of trade misinvoicing.
                 Figure 2. Terms that are often perceived to be equivalent
In recent years it is becoming increasingly clear that the trade misinvoicing estimates are
problematic both in terms of understanding the scale and nature of customs fraud and as
indicators of the kinds of structures and practices that major corporation use for tax
planning.

"
"374","3.1 Problem I: Gaps and mismatches in trade data don’t reliably
reflect misinvoicing
Trade misinvoicing certainly is a real phenomenon. For example business people in China
have used overpayments for imports as a means to get around the country’s currency
controls, and build up an nest egg of savings outside China. Companies in South Africa
smuggle in shipments of clothing from China evading import duties. 6 Dealers in Tanzanite
has been found to be smuggling the gemstone out of Tanzania including in private cars and
carried by Maasai herdsmen. 7 In Venezuela scammers used inflated import invoices to buy
cheap dollars from the official currency control agency. In Nigeria oil is sold from the
national oil company at advantageous prices to politically well-connected middlemen known
as “briefcase companies” who sell it on at a significant margin without serving any
commercial function, essentially privatising what should be public revenue. In 2015 Côte
d’Ivoire Customs issued 2,420 fraud reports. The offences most commonly recorded by
frontline services are false values, false goods, and false weight declarations (Victorien
Gnogoue, 2017).
However, while it is clear that customs fraud is real, it is not clear that the influential and
widely quoted figures based on adding up gaps and mismatches in trade data can be directly
interpreted as trade misinvoicing.
The theory of assessing trade misinvoicing is simple. When a shipment of goods crosses a
border the importer or exporter declares what is in the container: 12 dozen cuddly toys
valued at $1 each say, or twenty tonnes of copper valued at $4,000 per tonne. If the unit
value and the amount declared match with what is actually in the container then there is no
illicit flow. The correct tariff and VAT are levied, any export credits are correctly awarded,
and eventually the companies involved will pay the right amount of corporate income tax,
given the profit or loss they made on the deal.
However the exporter or importer may seek to evade tariffs or taxes or hide a payment to an
associate by declaring a value that does not reflect the real value of the goods (in either
direction—higher or lower). Thus if there is a difference between what is declared and the
actual nature, quantity, or value of the goods then this may be customs fraud and diversion
of funds.

"375","                  Figure 3. Trade misinvoicing: Volume, price, and value
If for example the container really contained 22 tonnes of copper, or the cuddly toys were
worth $10 each, the value of the additional two tonnes of copper or the additional nine
dollars per toy would be an illicit flow and could indicate a side payment being made through
collusion between the buyer and seller and not declared for tax purposes (this mechanism
can also be used as a channel for paying bribes or making kickbacks, as well as for evading
currency controls).
Customs inspectors may be able verify the actual volume and nature of individual cargo
shipments and assess whether the price and overall value declared are correct. Large scale
estimates of trade misinvoicing, however, rely on comparing trade statistics: looking at the
declared value of transactions at one end of the trade (when the cargo is exported) with the
value declared at the other (when it is imported). This “mirror data” approach of comparing
what country A reports as an export to B and what country B reports as an import from A
(or vice versa) is the basis for the widely cited trade misinvoicing studies, such as those
carried out regularly by Global Financial Integrity as well as others such as UNECA/ High
Level Panel (2015), and Boyce and Ndikumana (2012). In each case the calculation assumes
that, where there is a developed country on one side of the trade, and the developing country
on the other, the price and volume declared to its authorities and compiled into trade
statistics on the developed country side will be correct (due to greater capacity for customs
enforcement), and that, allowing for insurance and freight costs, any further difference
between the trades reported by bilateral pairs of countries indicates trade misinvoicing.

"376","Most commonly studies use a rule of thumb of allowing a 10 percent margin for insurance
and freight, but some seek to take a more sophisticated approach applying different margins
for different types of good.
                Figure 4. Estimating trade misinvoicing using mirror data
The estimation problem is that not all trade misinvoicing shows up as mismatches in the
trade data, and not all mismatches in the trade data are evidence of misinvoicing.
This was illustrated clearly in 2016 when The UN Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) published a study on trade misinvoicing of commodities under the headline
“some countries are losing 67% of the value of their exports.” It highlighted specific
instances which it saw as evidence of this level of misinvoicing (Ndikumana, 2016).
The report by Professor Léonce Ndikumana analysed mismatches in international trade data
in the UN COMTRADE database for seven country-commodity pairs: gold,
silver/platinum, and iron ore from South Africa; copper from Chile and Zambia; cocoa from
Côte d’Ivoire; and oil from Nigeria. In all seven cases it came to a single conclusion: there
were substantial levels of misinvoicing. However in most of the cases a simpler explanation
could be readily found.
     •   South African gold: The UNCTAD report calculated that “virtually all gold
         exported by South Africa leaves the country unreported,” accusing mining
         companies of smuggling billions of dollars’ worth of gold. This was promptly
         disputed by the South African Chamber of Mines and the South African Revenue
                                               14

"377","          Authority. The Chamber of Mines commissioned an independent report from
          economics consultancy Eunomix (2016) which found that the mining companies
          and public agencies do report gold exports, just not in the right format for
          COMTRADE. They found that three quarters of the observed discrepancy could be
          explained just by looking up the official statistics.
      •   Zambian copper: Copper is one of Zambia main exports. Trade statistics show
          that more copper is exported from Zambia to Switzerland and the UK than arrives
          in these destinations, but more Zambian copper arrives in countries such as China,
          Korea, Italy, and Saudi Arabia than Zambia reports as exports to those them. This
          has often been interpreted as indicating massive tax evasion and capital flight
          associated with copper exports from Zambia. 8 The UNCTAD report the trade
          statistics as showing underinvoicing and overinvoicing in the two directions.
          However it is more readily explainable by merchanting trade involving trading
          companies in Switzerland and the UK, and by the London Metals Exchange system
          of bonded warehouses. For example if copper is reported as an export from Zambia
          to Switzerland, but in practice sits in a bonded warehouse before being delivered to
          Germany, this would show up as “overinvoiced exports” to Switzerland and
          “underinvoiced exports” to Germany, even if at each stage of consignment the

      •   South African silver and platinum: The analysis suggested overall high levels of
          misinvoicing, made up of a combination of years when the discrepancy in the trade
          data is relatively small, and a few years when there are substantial discrepancies. In
          other words, it describes a scenario where the industry swung from legal
          compliance, to massive undetected smuggling, and then back again on an annual
          basis (and that no one noticed). This seems unlikely. It is notable that the
          COMTRADE database contains no record of South Africa’s platinum exports in
          2000 and 2002, but SARS statistics show normal levels of platinum exports. The
          UNCTAD study attributes several billions of dollars’ worth of underinvoicing by
          exporters to the gap in the COMTRADE data for these two years.
      •   Chilean copper: The study found significant overinvoicing of copper from Chile
          (i.e., copper imports from Chile are reported to be worth less than copper exports,
          given a 10 percent allowance for insurance and freight). This is likely to reflect
          shipping costs being lower than 10 percent. Copper cathode sells at about $5,000 /
          tonne, while freight shipping rates are measured in tens of dollars. Relatively
          valuable but non-perishable goods such as this are likely to appear to be
          overinvoiced by exporters because of their relatively low actual freight costs.
      •   South African iron ore: The study observed a “drastic” shift from apparent
          underinvoicing to overinvoicing—suggesting illicit outflows, followed by illicit
          inflows. However this may also be explainable through relative transport costs. Iron

          precipitously, thus the margin of difference would have changed without indicating
          alleged secret side deals inexplicably being renegotiated.
By looking at individual commodities it is possible to see that price volatility, transit and
merchanting trade, and the use of bonded warehouses can result in large trade data
discrepancies arising from legitimate trade. In particular ordinary, legitimate trade can
generate systematic discrepancies in trade data involving three countries. For example a
single shipment of copper could lead to apparent underinvoicing from Zambia-Switzerland
and equal apparent overinvoicing from Zambia-Germany.
Global Financial Integrity’s “Gross Excluding Reversals” method is based on the same
general principle as the UNCTAD study (but uses aggregate “Direction of Trade” statistics),
while the UNECA High Level Panel report on Illicit Financial Flows (“Africa is losing $50
billion to misinvoicing”) uses a similar methodology. The same country-commodity pairs as
those that feature in the UNCTAD study are strong contributors to the UNECA total, with
60 percent of apparent misinvoicing relating to oil, precious metals, ore, machinery, copper
and iron, and steel. In fact, gold, silver, and platinum are the second largest source of alleged
misinvoicing in the UNECA study, and almost all of this relates to Southern Africa, where it
now seems likely that the explanation is far more pedestrian.

"379","Further clues that ordinary merchanting and transit trade may be responsible for a large part
of what is picked up in trade misinvoicing estimates can be seen from the overall pattern of
trade reported globally. Carriere and Grigoriou (2014) note that discrepancies (“missing
exports and phantom imports”) are very common when looking at country-commodity pairs
at a detailed level, but that they cancel out when looking at wider commodity categories and
world trade. CEPII, the French research institute which manages the BACI trade database,
analysed 5000 products over ten years in the UN COMTRADE database and find that the
declared quantities of commodities traded between country pairs were only similar in 11
percent of cases (Gaulier et al, 2008). For example reported exports of cocoa from the
Netherlands are consistently greater than reported imports of cocoa from the Netherlands
by partners (mainly developed countries, particularly Germany). The widespread nature of
quantity divergences in trade statistics even between developed countries with strong
customs and statistical capacity means that the assumption that the trade statistics at the
developed country side are a sound benchmark against which any divergence can be
interpreted as “misinvoicing” should not be taken for granted.
It is striking that globally, imports and exports track each other closely, falling within the 10
percent margin conventionally allowed for the cost of transport and insurance overall.

"380","or could be caused by the value of shipments being correctly recorded under mismatched
country and/or commodity categories.
These observations provide concrete illustrations of the general problem with these
estimates. Volker Nitsch in his paper “Trillion Dollar Estimate: Illicit Financial Flows from
Developing Countries” reviews GFI’s “gross excluding reversals” methodology. He
concludes that the quantitative results have no substantive meaning and that therefore the
estimate of $800 million of trade misinvoicing globally “lacks evidence and is
uncorroborated.” The IMF and the UN, whose data these studies draw on, warn that the
statistics cannot be reliably used in this way. The IMF says, “we caution against attempting
to measure [illicit flows] by using discrepancies in macroeconomic datasets… official
estimates of trade misinvoicing cannot be derived by transforming trade data from the IMF
Trade Statistics and/or UN COMTRADE, either by individual country or in aggregate.” The
World Customs Organisation says that mirror trade analysis can be used as a risk assessment
tool to highlight potential cases of misinvoicing, but that before the findings of any mirror
analysis lead to assumptions of fraud they must then be verified by investigations in the field
or in-depth document reviews (Gnogoue, 2017).
3.2 Problem II: “Misinvoicing” is not mispricing
When Raymond Baker first wrote about the practice of misinvoicing in his book Capitalism’s
Achilles Heel (2005) he called it trade mispricing, and he drew from 550 with officials from
trading companies which largely focused on pricing. He said, “mispricing in order to
generate kickbacks into foreign bank accounts was treated as a well-understood and normal
part of transactions.”
However GFI’s core methodology which uses aggregate IMF “Direction of Trade” statistics
cannot differentiate mispricing from misdeclaration of quantities. Thus the language that
GFI uses was later changed from “mispricing” to “misinvoicing.”
Direction of Trade statistics only provide details of the aggregate value of trades—they don’t
give details of prices and quantities. Thus a mismatch in value might mean that the price was
misdeclared ($1 teddy bears instead of $10 ones) or that the quantity was misdeclared (22
tonnes of copper instead of 20) or it could reflect “orphan imports” or “missing exports”
where there is no record of the shipment at all on one side of the transaction. In each case
there might be innocent (green) or illicit (red) explanations as shown below.

cannot be used to tell the difference between a concentrated area of customs fraud hiding
amongst other compliant shipments and widespread marginal discrepancies of declared price

"
"382","            Figure 8. Concentrated fraud or widespread marginal differences?
The differences matter in practice because different types of misdeclaration represent
different types of behaviour by taxpayers, and could be closer or further away from the “grey
area” between legal and illegal action, and relatively harder or easier for customs officials to
detect in practice.
For example (aside from genuine administrative errors such as recording the wrong
commodity code or unit of measure by accident), misdeclaring the quantity or nature of a
shipment could be outright customs fraud (for example shipping cars and declaring them as
scrap metal, or shipping 20 kgs of gold but only declaring 5kg). Massively under- or over-
reporting prices could also be customs fraud (such as exporting buckets for $973 each), or
outright smuggling. However such cases are either technically easy to detect through visible
inspection or (somewhat harder, but still straightforwardly) through systems for monitoring
commodity exports, such as in the mining sector. If blatant huge misdeclarations of
quantities and prices (including outright smuggling) are taking place this suggests massive tax
evasion, with customs inspectors are looking the other way (whether through lack of capacity,
or complicity). This though is not what is usually understood as “mispricing.”

The only type of taxpayer behaviour which equates to BEPS type tax avoidance and which
might show up as discrepancies in trade data is transfer price manipulation being used to
shift profits to a third country. However these marginal price differences could also reflect
legitimate use of a marketing hub.
For example many mining companies use a subsidiary in marketing hub to sell commodities
to end consumers. It could charge a margin of 2-4 percent of the value of the commodity, or
even 6 percent if the hub takes physical and legal possession of the commodity or
undertakes innovative marketing or risk exposure (Readhead, 2016). Tax authorities might
challenge the level of the marketing charge on audit—as Australia has done recently with
BHP Billiton, and it could result in more tax being payable in a particular jurisdiction (and
perhaps less in another) but such disputes are not uncovering about clandestine transfers but
challenging the valuation of the service provided by the hub.
Often the term trade misinvoicing and trade mispricing are conflated suggesting that the
behaviour being described by the data is largely about price manipulation by companies
operating at the borders of legality by declaring barely acceptable transfer prices. However in
practice it appears that what the misinvoicing studies pick up often is destination mismatches
(which may well have ordinary explanations in transit and merchanting trade) and quantity
differences (which could have either criminal or ordinary explanations).

"384","  Box 2: Exploring prices, quantities and destinations: The case of cocoa
  Côte d’Ivoire has often been highlighted as a country which suffers large illicit flows from the cocoa
  trade—which makes up over 40 percent of its exports (Côte d’Ivoire cocoa features in both the
  UNCTAD report and High Level Panel report). The High Level Panel report states that cocoa is a
  significant source of IFFs, and that Côte d’Ivoire accounts for 38 percent of this.
  A simple calculation comparing cocoa exports and imports on a bilateral basis confirms that there
  are significant mismatches.9
     Figure 9. Calculating underinvoiced exports of cocoa from Côte d’Ivoire using the Gross
                                          Excluding Reversals methodology
  This reflects large bilateral mismatches—for example cocoa is reported as an export to Estonia,
  Belgium, and the Netherlands, but does not arrive there. Meanwhile more cocoa arrives in
  Germany, Russia, and France than is reported as exported to those destinations. Trade misinvoicing
  studies tend to interpret these mismatches as separate and unrelated smuggling reflecting illicit
  financial flows into and out of Côte d’Ivoire. However this seems less likely than the alternative
  scenario which is that cocoa bean wholesalers in countries such as Estonia, Belgium, and the
  Netherlands are buying cocoa beans which are then delivered (including via bonded warehouses) to
  chocolate manufacturers in countries such as Germany, Russia, and France. When we look at the
  price per kg of cocoa beans on export and import, there is in fact no sign of mispricing.
9 NB: the calculation done here is slightly simpler than GFI’s “Gross Excluding Reversals” methodology as it
treats all partner countries—both developed and developing equally, whereas GFI applies a slightly different
method when partner countries are also developing economies.

"
"385","         Figure 10. Export price and import price of cocoa from Côte d’Ivoire (USD/kg)
  If we look only at the quantity effect (how many kilogrammes of Ivorian cocoa beans are imported
  by the world compared to how many are exported from Côte d’Ivoire) there remains some
  discrepancy, which in most years is less than 10 percent (usually under, but sometimes over). This
  could reflect a degree of smuggling, cocoa beans going into or out of store, or cocoa beans from
  other countries being mislabelled. Similar analyses might be undertaken on other commodities to
  break down misinvoicing estimates into destination, price, and quantity effects.
3.3 Problem III: Findings from trade misinvoicing studies do not
reflect corporate practice by major multinational companies
Raymond Baker began to work on IFFs following his own experience as a business owner
and manager in a number of African countries. The practices that Baker describes from his
experience and interviews with other tightly-held companies suggest illicit behaviour. They
include misinvoicing in order to pay a bribe, generate a kickback, or to evade taxes or
currency controls, in each case to divert funds into hidden accounts. While multinational
corporations have too often been involved in corruption, this is not the kind of thing that is
generally being defended when companies face tax controversies and respond that “we pay
tax according to the rules.”
Shareholder owned companies in particular have procedures and controls in place to try to
prevent bribery, kickbacks, and embezzlement, as it would mean shareholders being
defrauded (Truman, 2010). Similarly where misinvoicing methodologies indicate large scale
smuggling or misdeclaration of quantities, again this is not the kind of practice that would be
defended as ordinary business. This is recognised by the African Tax Administration Forum
(ATAF, 2014) which notes that misinvoicing is not significantly related to multinational
corporations, and that while multinational corporations may undertake sophisticated tax
                                               23
"
"386","avoidance involving complex but well documented transfer pricing design, they do not tend
to undertake fraudulent activity. They distinguish this from the risks emanating from owners
and managers of closely held companies, noting that “there is evidence that business receipts
due to individuals or smaller businesses may be diverted to privately owned companies in tax
havens, with little or no justification or documentation.”
Nevertheless misinvoicing estimates have been used to stand in for multinational corporate
tax avoidance. The adoption of trade misinvoicing measures as indicators of the problem of
corporate tax avoidance has leads to a misperception of the nature of transfer pricing
issues—in particular assuming large hidden margins in commodity supply chains such as for
bananas and copper. Examples such as the “$973 bucket” and “the 50 pence fridge” which
derive from outliers in trade data have been widely used as popular explanations of transfer
pricing issues but bear no relationship to actual transfer pricing practices by major
corporations (Forstater, 2015).
  Box 3: The $973 bucket
  The $973 bucket (reportedly exported from the Czech Republic to the US) is a popular illustration
  that has been used as a demonstration of transfer pricing abuse, alongside others such as fenceposts
  from Canada at $1,853, a kilo of toilet paper from China for $4,122, and a pair of tweezers from
  Japan at $4,896. As Prem Sikka (2003) argued these “actual prices charged by some of the world’s
  biggest multinational corporations, all authorised by some of the best accountants, and by political
  friends in high places. Their game is to shift the tax burden onto somebody else. It is played through
  ‘transfer pricing’.” Similarly Eurodad (Ruiz and Romero, 2011) highlights the $973 bucket as a case of
  one US corporation using manipulated pricing schemes to avoid paying taxes. Forum Syd (Fröberg
  and Waris, 2013) also highlights the for $973 bucket as a case involving a profit shifting from a
  developing country to a tax haven. “A more realistic price paid on the open market would have been
  around one dollar. The rest of the price paid is just a way to shift profit to the subsidiary in the tax
  haven where less tax is paid.”
  If the famous $973 was a true reflection of corporate transfer pricing practice then it would it makes
  sense to view avoidance, misinvoicing, and illicit financial flows as so closely related that they cannot
  be differentiated. As Prem Sikka says ""They are suggestive of a widespread, systematic setting of
  transfer prices in whatever direction helps to avoid taxes and boost profits""
  However evidence for the $973 bucket does not come from a particular business that was caught at
  mispricing, but from analysis of US published trade data by Pak and Zdanowitz (2002). A more
  parsimonious explanation of the $973 bucket and the other similar examples is that they reflect
  mistakes in recording the quantity of items (for example the price of a shipment of items rather than a
  single item) or mistakes in the commodity code recorded. Certainly no one would try to defend these
  as “arms length prices” and the US Internal Revenue Service would challenge them if they tried
  (Lunnan, 1996 and Weisman, 2002)
                                                24
"
"387","3.4 Are there large hidden margins in commodity trading?
Cross border-criminals, money launderers, bribe payers, bribe takers, and tax evaders do hide
transactions amongst legitimate trade flow. Products such as diamonds, other gemstones,
and gold and jewellery are easy to smuggle, while other products such as oil may be stolen or
misreported. The problem is real. However the idea that such illicit financial flows can be
reliably identified through simple calculations using publicly available data appears
overoptimistic.
These calculations systematically transform records of ordinary trade flows into large
misinvoicing estimates which in turn have been interpreted as reflecting systematic and
egregious mispricing by multinational companies. They create perceptions that major
companies doing international business in developing countries must be getting away with
hiding vast illicit flows, while customs, revenue, and statistics agencies in developing
countries must all be utterly incompetent or complicit.
These calculations have supported a widely held perception of large hidden margins in
commodity supply chains. One common reading of the illicit flows estimates is that they
must reflect exploitation of primary producers through trading relationships which extract a
high margin on commodities. However, as the cocoa bean example above highlights
destination (i.e., volume) mismatches can have a much bigger effect on the numbers than
price effects, without indicating any illicit flow or hidden price margin.
Another reason to be sceptical of the idea that simple calculations on publicly available trade
data reveal large hidden margins in the commodity trade is that commodity trading is a
competitive business that is based on low margins and high volumes. If there was a better
deal to be done, or if traders found out that their competitors were making large margins,
this would be commercially valuable information, and would an opportunity for arbitrage.
Large scale misinvoicing estimates are often reported as a development issue, but have been
largely ignored by the financial and trade media, although if they had information about
hidden margins this would be highly material for traders. The experience of Fairtrade also
suggests that there is not a big margin in the supply chain of commodities such as cocoa, tea,
and coffee which can simply be reallocated to producers.

"
"388","Box 4: Acacia Mining: A case of massive illicit flows?
Developing countries face real challenges in securing revenues from natural resources. However,
inflated expectations of massive hidden margins can contribute to policy instability and undermine
government accountability. One current example of this is the dispute between Acacia Mining and
the Government of Tanzania (see Forstater and Readhead, 2017). There have long been concerns
about whether Acacia Mining is paying enough tax in Tanzania. Between 2010 and 2015, Acacia
paid $444 million in dividends to shareholders, despite not yet paying any income tax in Tanzania.
There is a widespread belief expressed in the media and by politicians that underlying Acacia’s tax
affairs are mechanisms which enable it to illicitly export much of the value of its products.
However analysis of mining revenues by Open Oil (2016) highlight that the main reason for the
lack of corporate tax is that there were generous fiscal terms in the original mining agreement,
specifically an additional capital allowance, that meant Acacia could deduct 100 percent of its $4
billion investment, plus a 15 percent margin, before paying any income tax.
In March 2017 an export ban was introduced on unprocessed minerals and ores. Exports of
concentrate (an intermediary product between ore and metal) were halted due to the ban. In May
2017, President Magufuli appointed two special committees to investigate the contents of 277 of
the containers stuck at the port. The first committee reported that the concentrate contained
around twice as much copper and silver, and around eight times as much gold than was declared
by the company. They also detected a range of other metals. If the committees’ findings are
accurate, the extent of the undervaluation would be enormous, amounting to almost $4 billion
annually (one tenth of Tanzania’s GDP). The second committee scaled these figures up to cover
61,320 containers exported between 1998 and 2017, suggesting the true value of concentrate
exports was $83 billion and that the government had lost $31 billion of revenue trade due to
misinvoicing and transfer price manipulation. The company maintains they have always declared
all materials produced and paid all royalties and taxes that are due, while The Tanzania Mineral
Audit Agency (TMAA) undertakes careful work to monitor minerals exports.
The committee’s belief that they have uncovered a case of massive misinvoicing (i.e.,
misrepresentation of the value or quantity of exports) does not seem plausible for economic and
geological reasons (Forstater and Readhead, 2017). The committee’s reports suggest that the mine
was producing massive amounts of unreported gold, iridium, and ytterbium, but that this has been
covered up. This would mean an extraordinary conspiracy, including defrauding shareholders.

"
"389","4. “Tax-havens”: The meeting point between IFFs and tax
avoidance?
Another argument is made that illicit financial flows and corporate profit shifting are
fundamentally the same phenomena because they both involve “tax havens” and/or
“secrecy jurisdictions.” The three topics of IFFs, havens, and multinational profit shifting are
often considered together (for example see Fjeldstad et al, 2017), particularly by civil society
networks and the media. The linkage between tax havens, illicit financial flows, and
multinational corporate taxation goes back to the early days of Norway’s advocacy
engagement (Tilley, 2016) and can be seen in the original Draining Development book (World
Bank, 2012).
Sol Picciotto (2018) makes a strong form of the argument stating that any financial
transaction or structure that takes place “offshore” (a term that he does not define) is by
definition illicit:
         “Offshore is a murky world which facilitates a range of criminal, illegal, illegitimate
         and undesirable practices, all covered by the broad term illicit. …. It is sometimes
         said that many of these activities are ‘perfectly legal’, and hence legitimate. However,
         if they are legal, there is no need to carry them out offshore. Offshore devices or
         structures all involve using the laws or facilities of another country to obtain an
         advantage not possible under the law that should apply. Private persons’ bank
         accounts, financial information and other aspects of their personal affairs are
         generally protected in all countries by laws on confidentiality and privacy, which can
         only be overridden in specified circumstances, when there is a public interest. There
         is a network of tax treaties aimed at preventing double taxation, and in any case
         countries wishing to attract investments generally provide inducements, not excess
         taxation. Resorting to an offshore arrangement always involves trying to get around
         an inconvenient law – dodging the law.”
This categorical equation between “offshore/ tax havens” and “illicit” seems overly
sweeping. Everywhere is “offshore” to everywhere else. While it is certainly true that people
and enterprises can access legal frameworks that more convenient and advantageous than if
they were confined to their home jurisdiction, this does not necessarily mean that they are
evading or breaking rules at home or that they are doing something illegitimate.
Piciotto’s formulation seems to rely on the idea that there is a single set of laws which
“should” apply to every person or enterprise. However a wealthy international family which
owns properties in several countries, a multinational enterprise managing risk, assets, and
inventories across borders, or a joint-venture involving investors from several different
countries all face choice of jurisdictions to use for legal structures and financial assets in the
ordinary course of their affairs—and whichever they choose will be “offshore” to some
parties.
Nor should it be assumed that people everywhere enjoy the confidence that information
held by banks or public authorities is securely held and protected from political or criminal
                                                 27

"390","interference. Zucman (2017) finds that countries whose residents have the largest stock of
offshore assets compared to GDP include autocracies (such as Saudi Arabia or Russia) and
countries with a recent history of autocratic rule (such as Argentina or Greece), suggesting
that lack of confidence in legal protections at home could be a key motivation for offshore
holdings. Similarly not every country has institutions that enable businesses to raise capital
on foreign stock markets, access reliable courts, or use flexible and sophisticated financial
products. Jason Sharman (2012) finds for example that it is these factors, rather than
criminal money or tax arbitrage, that explain the popularity of the British Virgin Islands as a
conduit for investment into China (including round-tripping by Chinese investors).
Development finance institutions investing public money in private enterprises regularly
route their investments through tax havens as a means to overcome shortcomings in the
legal systems in the poor and capital-scarce countries in which they invest (Carter, 2017).
Multinational corporations tend not to seek out jurisdictions with weak legal or financial
governance or those with extreme secrecy. For example Oxfam (2017) found that the top 5
“tax havens” where European banks earn profits are Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Belgium,
Ireland, and Singapore (only two of which score below 60 on the Tax Justice Network’s
Financial Secrecy Index). Simply deeming that everything involving international finance that
goes on in these places is murky and “illicit” requires stretching the definition far beyond
boundaries which relate to the law.
The use of international financial system to enable tax evasion, and hiding of stolen assets, is
clearly a problem. Preventing financial institutions, and the financial centres that host them,
from being used in this way by crime syndicates, kleptocrats, and opportunistic tax evaders is
core to the illicit financial flows agenda. However the role that international financial centres
play in mediating investment, enabling people to diversify their assets, and supporting global
commerce are also critical benefits to society. Too little is known about the how much of
what takes place offshore is beneficial, defensible, or objectionable, and bundling these
categories together under the “illicit” umbrella will not support greater clarity and
understanding.

"391","5. Conclusion
The distinction between doing something that is currently against the law (or that abets
those seeking to get away with illegal acts) and doing something that is within the bounds of
civil liberties is critical to protecting civil rights and freedoms. It is fundamental to the
democratic political process and the rule of law that laws are set by the legislature and
interpreted by the judiciary.
Legislative changes can shift behaviours from one category to the other (as has been the case
with the BEPS), and administrative improvements and information sharing can make it
easier to determine which side of the line activities are on—but the distinction remains
important. Using a conceptual definition of illicit financial flows which combines what
is illegal with what uncertain, or what is judged to be undesirable by some unelected group,
undermines and confuses accountability and understanding.
A careful analysis of the trade misinvoicing estimates and cases, and of the role of
international financial centres does do not support the view that illicit financial flows, legal
tax avoidance and the use of “tax havens” are categorically the same. Nor, as it is sometimes
stated, is it true that corruption is only a minor part of the IFFs agenda, dwarfed by massive
outflows related to multinational investment.
                              Figure 11. These terms are not equivalent
Ultimately the question of how the term “IFF” is defined will only settled by those that
define and use it, whether as international organisations, governments, researchers and
academics, or activists. While different players have different perspectives, they have a
common interest in strengthening administration of tax law so that it is neither weakly
enforced, nor capricious and predatory. This is positive for citizens, businesses, and
government, and ultimately critical for sustainable development.
Concentrating on battling definitions may be seen as a distraction from this underlying
common objective, but incompatible language can become a barrier to understanding and
dialogue. Being clearer about the distinction between acts of tax fraud and evasion (alongside
                                                     29

"392","bribery, corruption, money laundering, and theft of public assets) on one hand and tax
avoidance and tax uncertainty on the other does not entail an absolute “parting of the ways”
of tax and anti-corruption, but a clearer understanding of issues and potential solutions. 10
Transparency and accountability of fiscal regimes (including in areas such as the extractive
sector), ending abuse of anonymous companies, tackling customs fraud, and rationalising
and regularising tax incentives are areas of common ground which necessitate collaboration.
Certainly, globally integrated value chains combined with complex (and sometimes
incomplete) tax rules mean that the tax affairs of major multinational companies will always
be challenged or adjusted. There are wider questions about how the international tax system
should be developed to address the digital economy and to better serve developing
countries. However, bracketing questions of how to allocate international taxing rights along
complex international value chains into the same category as prosecuting theft of public
assets, or money laundering of criminal proceeds, implies guilt-by-association which is not
be helpful for public-private dialogue, development of effective fiscal regimes and
accountability, or cooperative compliance.

In an economy where corruption is pervasive, how should tax inspectors be compensated?
The optimal compensation scheme must take into account the strategic interaction between
taxpayers and tax inspectors. Pure “tax farming” (paying tax inspectors a share of their tax
collections) is optimal only when all tax inspectors are corruptible. When there are both
honest and corruptible inspectors, the optimal compensation scheme lies -between pure tax
farming and a pure wage scheme. Paradoxically, when inspectors are hired beforehand, it
may be optimal to oﬀer contracts that attract corruptible inspectors but not the honest ones.
Key words: Tax evasion, Corruption, Signaling game

"
"428","1     Introduction
The treatment of tax evasion in the tax compliance literature dates back at least to the classic
paper of Allingham and Sandmo (1972). The tax administration needs to design an audit strategy
in order to deter or reduce evasion. Audits that allow to disclose true, as opposed to reported,
incomes are then carried out by agents whose objectives are assumed to be in line with the
goals of the tax administration. This however overlooks the role of utility-maximizing agents,
whose objectives may conflict with that of the administration. Such agents can and may side-
contract with citizens to evade tax payments. In fact, in a hierarchical structure where a principal
delegates a task to an agent along with some discretion over certain decisions, there is much room
for collusion.
    One of the first attempts to formalize collusion in a hierarchy using the principal-agent frame-
work can be found in Tirole (1986). Since then, a large corruption and tax administration literature
has emerged. Chander and Wilde (1992) generalize the tax evasion paper of Graetz et al. (1986)
by taking into account the possibility of collusion between a tax evader and an oﬃcial auditor
whose cost of dishonesty is (relatively) low. In their a two-class economy only high-income indi-
viduals have the possibility to evade. It all begins when taxpayers send required income reports
to the tax agency, which opens the door to strategic transmission of information. Chander and
Wilde (1992), however, do not address the problem of optimal remuneration of the inspectors.
This problem is dealt with by Besley and McLaren (1993), Hindriks et al. (1999), and Mookherjee
and Png (1995) in diﬀerent contexts.
    Besley and McLaren (1993) compare three distinct remuneration schemes, that provide dif-
ferent incentives to the inspectors. They characterize the conditions under which each scheme
generates the greatest amount of tax revenues net of administration costs. They consider in a
simple model the existence of honest as well as dishonest inspectors and taxpayers. The presence
of diﬀerent types of auditors introduces an adverse selection dimension. However, even though
                                                  1
"
"429","monitoring is costly, there is no moral hazard problem since it is the principal that monitors and
exerts costly eﬀort to disclose corruption. Hindriks et al. (1999) consider a model where all the
actors are dishonest. They however allow for general remuneration schemes and more importantly
for extortion. Finally, Mookherjee and Png’s (1995) paper, to which this one is closely related,
also considers only corruptible agents but they remove the exogenous matching of the auditor and
the evader (polluter in their case) often assumed in the literature. They consider a moral hazard
problem since for evasion to be disclosed the inspector has to exert a costly nonobservable eﬀort.
    Our model distinguishes itself from the models cited above in several respects. Like Chander
and Wilde (1992), we consider the existence of strategic information transmission, but use a more
general model with a continuum of possible incomes. In most of the literature on corruption, the
bribe the evader pays the inspector is the solution of a Nash bargain and the parties agree to report
the income that maximizes their joint profit. In contrast to the literature, in this model, the tax
evader chooses unilaterally the amount to evade. Therefore, the report may be diﬀerent from the
one that maximizes the joint expected profit. We also allow for both moral hazard as in Mookherjee
and Png and adverse selection as in Besley and McLaren. General remuneration schemes ranging
from pure tax-farming to pure wage systems are also allowed. Finally, corruption is considered to
be structural, i.e., given a weak judiciary system and mild punishments for corruption or evasion,
collusion is always beneficial. This assumption fits well with the situation in many developing
countries. This paper investigates the remuneration contract that maximizes the tax receipts of
the administration in an environment with structural corruption. The tax and penalty systems
are set up by the social planner, while the tax administration has total discretion over the form
of the contracts it proposes to its employees.
    The remainder of the paper is as follows. The next section describes the diﬀerent actors of the
model. Section 2.1 models the relationship between the auditors and the taxpayers as a signaling
game. Section 3 solves the model, first in the case where all inspectors are identical and second
when they diﬀer. Section 4 considers the implications of diﬀerent extensions of the model. Section

2      The general setting
Consider an economy with a continuum of taxpayers endowed with exogenous incomes on which
taxes must be paid. The distribution of income in the economy is common knowledge and denoted
f (θ) on the support Θ = [θ, θ]; however, a particular taxpayer’s income is private information and
can be observed only through costly audits. Therefore, taxpayers may misreport their income.
Tax compliance is enforced by the tax agency, the fund-raising arm of the government, which is
composed of tax inspectors (or auditors) that review the taxpayers’ reports. An auditor is assigned
the task of detecting attempted fraud and denouncing the evaders in exchange for remuneration
determined by the tax agency. In order to discover cheaters, the auditors need to exert a costly
nonobservable eﬀort. Moreover, some may pursue their own agenda and be prone to bribery.
Subsequent to a side-contract between a taxpayer and an inspector, an additional audit can take
place with a given exogenous probability. This audit will reveal the true income of the taxpayer
and whether corruption occurred or not, with the agents fined accordingly. The taxpayers and
inspectors are risk-neutral and the tax agency aims at maximizing its revenue. Let us now provide
a more formal description of the diﬀerent actors of the economy and their interactions.
    The government, as a passive actor, determines the environment in which the tax agency,
taxpayers, and inspectors evolve. This environment consists of the tax and penalty system given
by the following triplet hT, φa , φt i, where T is the tax function and T (θ) represents the amount
of tax an individual who reports an income θ and has not been proven to earn another income
will have to pay; φi for i = a, t represent the fine functions where a stands for auditor and t for
taxpayer. Therefore, φt (θ, m) is the fine a tax evader with income θ reporting m must pay in
addition to the full tax liability, and φa (θ, m) is the fine owed by the inspector that shielded the
evader in exchange for a bribe. The functions display the following properties for i = a, t:
                                                    3
"
"431","(i) T (θ) < θ and T 0 (θ) ≥ 0, (ii) φi (θ, m) ≥ 0 for all m, θ, (iii) φi (θ, m) is non-decreasing in θ,
(iv) φi (θ, m) is non-increasing in m, (v) φi (θ, θ) = 0.
Condition (i) states that tax liabilities cannot exceed income and are nondecreasing with it. From
condition (ii), over- and under-reporting are both sanctioned, conditions (iii) and (iv) ensure that
the fines increase as the distance between true and reported incomes widens. Finally, condition
(v) rules out rewards for truthful reports.
    The tax agency has complete discretion over the remuneration scheme of the auditors. The
payment to inspectors is fully determined by the couple (w, η) where w ∈ IR is a fixed wage paid
for every file reviewed and η ∈ [0, 1] is a commission rate on a specific file. The tax agency pays
therefore a salary of w+ηT (θ) to an inspector that audits a report of θ. The tax agency’s objective
is to maximize revenue and it is aware of the possibility for evasion and corruption. All the reports
confirmed by the auditors are verified again with an exogenous probability λ (determined out of
the model) and true income is then perfectly assessed. If true income as revealed by the audit
is diﬀerent from the reported and confirmed income, it is possible to distinguish cases of pure
evasion from those where corruption also took place, i.e., the auditor can prove that no bribery
occurred and that shirking is the reason for not discovering the true income of the taxpayer.
    Each taxpayer has an exogenous income θ ∈ Θ which is private information and is sometimes
referred to as the taxpayer’s type. The taxpayer sends an income report to the tax agency and
aims at maximizing the expected payoﬀ such a report implies. A strategy for a taxpayer is a
function
                                            s : Θ 7−→ M
where m = s(θ) is the report a taxpayer sends if θ is the true income. In choosing this strategy,
the taxpayer also takes into account a possible visit of an inspector who may be either corruptible
or honest. Such a taxpayer evades the amount u(θ, m) = T (θ) − T (m).
    The auditor is oﬀered a remuneration contract by the tax agency for the collection of taxes.
                                                    4
"
"432","The contract is accepted or rejected by the auditor if its expected payoﬀ is lower than what can be
obtained elsewhere, i.e., on the reservation utility. It is assumed that the inspector is hired from
a large pool of people, and that an exogenous proportion, β, of the individuals composing the
pool is prone to corruption. Because it is impossible to distinguish a corruptible from an honest
inspector, there is an adverse selection problem. Moreover, because an auditor spends costly and
unobservable eﬀort to investigate a report in order to discover hard evidence of evasion, there is
also a moral hazard problem. A strategy for the auditors is a function
                                 ei : M   7−→ I = [0, 1] for i = h, d
where ei (m) is the level of eﬀort the auditor devotes to a file reporting an income m, where h
stands for honest and d for dishonest. The eﬀort level is normalized to represent the probability
of discovering the true income of the taxpayer. There is a disutility of eﬀort ψ(ei ) in monetary
terms. It is assumed that ψ0 ≥ 0, ψ00 ≥ 0, and ψ(0) = ψ0 (0) = 0. From the meeting of a corruptible
inspector and an evader, corruption can emerge, the evader paying a bribe to the inspector who
in turn confirms the false report.
    The timing of the game is the following:
   1. A move by nature determines the couple (β, λ).
   2. The government announces the tax function T (θ), and the fine functions φi (θ, m) for i = a, t;
   3. The tax agency then announces the remuneration scheme (w, η).
   4. Each taxpayer sends an income report to the tax agency.
   5. A corruptible or honest auditor verifies the report where income m is declared, forms some
      beliefs about the true type of the taxpayer, and devotes an eﬀort ei (m) to the file, for i = h, d.
   6. The auditor and the taxpayer meet and one of the following states of nature materializes
         • the auditor fails to discover the taxpayer’s true type and confirms the report;
                                                   5
"
"433","          • the agent discovers the taxpayer’s true income θ, negotiates a bribe b(θ, m) and confirms
             the report;
          • the agent discovers the taxpayer’s true income and announces it to the tax agency.
   7. For all the confirmed reports, a move by nature determines whether or not the file will be
       audited (with probability λ).
2.1      The auditor-taxpayer problem
The relationship between the taxpayer and the auditor concerns stages 4 to 6 of the above timing.
Involving two players, one moving first by sending a message that conditions the second player’s
action, this game belongs to the class of signaling games. The taxpayer (sender) sends a message
(the report) to the auditor (the receiver) whose strategy (the intensity of audit) depends on this
information. Thus, there exists strategic information transmission.
2.1.1     The signaling game
The signaling sub-game between the taxpayer and the inspector occurs if and only if the inspector
                                                           r θ
has accepted the remuneration contract.1 It can be represented by the following game tree:

     Condition (i) states that taxpayers choose reports that maximize their expected payoﬀ given
the audit strategy of the inspectors. Condition (ii) implies that the auditors’ strategies are best
to that of the taxpayers given the beliefs they hold. It also implies a consistency requirement that
both honest and dishonest auditors have the same beliefs in and out of equilibrium. Condition (iii)
gives the beliefs of the auditors about the type of the taxpayers based on their reports. The eﬀort
levels exerted by h- and d-auditors are indirectly linked through the strategy of the taxpayers,
which depends on both eﬀorts. It remains now to make explicit the payoﬀs of the diﬀerent players.
We assume all are risk neutral and thus want to maximize disposable income.

"435","    The honest auditors refuse all bribery by definition. One can imagine that the cost they bear
from the stigma of being caught in corruption is infinite; the value of their integrity is priceless.
Their expected payoﬀ from auditing a report of m emanating from a θ-taxpayer is
                  V h (θ, m, eh ; w, η) = w + ηT (m) + ηeh (m)IEµ [u(θ, m)] − ψ(eh (m)),          (1)
which is the sum of the salary paid for a report m and the extra profit that accrues when the
auditing eﬀort allows for discovering and denouncing the evader minus the cost of the eﬀort.
    The corruptible auditors, on the contrary, are motivated solely by bribery whenever it is
profitable. They incur no cost from the stigma of being caught. However, whenever an evader
oﬀers them a bribe b(θ, m), they can be audited and fined afterwards. The expected payoﬀ of the
dishonest auditors is therefore given by
           V d (θ, m, ed ; w, η) = w + ηT (m) + ed (m)IEµ [b(θ, m) − λφa (θ, m)] − ψ(ed (m)).     (2)
Their payoﬀ has the same structure as that of the honest auditors except that the reward they
get from auditing equals the bribe minus the expected value of the fine.
    To compute the expected utility of a dishonest θ-taxpayer who reports m, we need to consider
the game tree given in figure 1. The payoﬀ at each final node is as follows: (1) = (6) = T (m),
(2) = (5) = (7) = T (θ)+φt (θ, m), (3) = T (m)+b(θ, m) and finally (4) = T (θ)+φt (θ, m)+b(θ, m).
Taking the expectation of the diﬀerent payoﬀs gives the expected utility
      U(θ, m; eh , ed ) = θ − T (θ) + u(θ, m)
                               −[λ + β(1 − λ)eh (m)](u(θ, m) + φt (θ, m)) − (1 − β)ed (m)b(θ, m). (3)
With respect to a truthful report, there is an expected premium from cheating that is given by
the last three terms. The first one is the evaded amount saved for sure and enters the premium
with a positive sign; the last two terms constitute the expected disbursement the taxpayer will
suﬀer, depending on whether the audit is carried out by a corruptible or honest auditor and the

"
"436","subsequent audit, and have a negative sign. A taxpayer’s evasion decision depends on the sign of
this premium. Evasion occurs if and only if it is positive.
    An important property of the signaling game played by taxpayers and auditors is monotonicity.
Monotonic signaling games constitute an important class of games since many refinements are
equivalent, i.e., lead to the same selection of equilibria, in this class as shown by Cho and Sobel
(1990). In a monotonic signaling game, all the senders have the same preferences over the set of
pure best responses of the receivers. In this game, monotonicity must be considered with respect to
both types of auditors. The game is clearly monotonic since all taxpayers prefer lower probabilities
of audit from the honest (resp. dishonest) auditors that of the dishonest (resp. honest) ones being
fixed. Formally, U (θ, m; ei , ej ) > U (θ, m; ei0 , ej ) for all θ ∈ Θ and m ∈ M, for ei < ei0 , and ej
fixed, for i, j = h, d and i 6= j.
2.1.2    The bribery
In the above signaling game, bribery arises only when a dishonest auditor exerts suﬃcient eﬀort
to find evidence of evasion. The above model diﬀers from earlier contributions in corruption
because the taxpayer is sovereign over the report to send. The auditor can only confirm the
report or denounce the evader. Therefore, if the auditor accepts a bribe, the report is not forcefully
maximizing the joint expected surplus of the players as is usual in the literature. This also rules
out the possibility of extortion considered by Hindricks et al. (1999). Suppose a θ-taxpayer who
reported m has been discovered by a corruptible auditor. Under which conditions will bribery
emerge, and what is the price to pay for the auditor to confirm the report? This price is negotiated
by the parties, which are assumed to have identical bargaining powers and adopt the Nash solution.
The threat point is denouncement in which case the taxpayer pays T (θ)+φt (θ, m) and the auditor
receives w +ηT (θ)−ψ(e(m)). If the players agree on corruption, the taxpayer pays b to the auditor
who confirms the report, but with a probability λ they are again caught and this time fined. The
taxpayer’s expected payment is therefore (1 − λ)T (m) + b + λ[T (θ) + φt (m, θ)] while the auditor
                                                        9
"
"437","expects to receive w + ηT (m) + b − λφa (θ, m) − ψ(e(m)). By an obvious computation the expected
gains from corruption are obtained as the diﬀerence between the agreement and the disagreement
payoﬀs. The expected gain of the taxpayer is:
                              Pte (θ, m, b) = (1 − λ)[u(θ, m) + φt (θ, m)] − b
and that of the auditor:
                                 Pae (θ, m, b) = b − λφa (θ, m) − ηu(θ, m).
A bribe will be paid if and only if both players gain from it, i.e., the price is not too high for the
taxpayer and not too low for the auditor. A necessary condition for bribery is thus:
                          (1 − λ)[u(θ, m) + φt (θ, m)] > λφa (θ, m) + ηu(θ, m).                     (4)
Throughout the paper, this condition is assumed to hold because the institutional setting is
working so poorly that agents always find it profitable to engage in bribery. So the joint expected
profit from corruption is
                        e
                      Pa,t = (1 − λ)[u(θ, m) + φt (θ, m)] − λφa (θ, m) − ηu(θ, m).                  (5)
Note that the bribe does not appear in the formula because it merely redistributes profit and does
not aﬀect its value. Moreover, this value is fixed ex ante by (the choice of) the taxpayer and the
inspector cannot influence it, or at least influences it only indirectly through the auditing strategy.
This is in contrast to most of the literature, which often assumes that the parties jointly decide
on the report that maximizes their joint expected profit. The discretion of the taxpayer over the
report enables her by the same token to set the amount of the bribe once the rules of the game
are fixed. As already noted, the bribe is bargained à la Nash and since the bargaining powers are
equal, the expected gains from bribery are equalized. This gives a bribe equal to
                              1
                   b(θ, m) =     [(1 − λ + η)u(θ, m) + (1 − λ)φt (θ, m) + λφa (θ, m)] .             (6)
                              2
For θ (resp. m) fixed, the bribe decreases (resp. increases) with m (resp. θ). As long as bribery
is profitable, strengthening the repression by for instance increasing the fine functions or raising
                                                      10
"
"438","the salary of the inspector through the variable component η, increases the price of the auditor’s
silence. Intuitively, increasing φt increases the cost the taxpayer would support if denounced;
increasing φa or η makes corruption costlier for the auditor. A higher probability of detection
however decreases the bribe. Therefore, increasing φa and η while lowering φt until (4) is violated
is the way to stop corruption. This operation however does not forcefully guarantee a reduction
in evasion. Indeed, the dishonest taxpayers may still find it rewarding to understate their income
even if they are certainly punished whenever caught.
2.2     The tax agency problem
The preceding section analyzed the game played by taxpayers and inspectors assuming the latter
accepted the proposed remuneration contract. Since the tax agency oﬀers a take-it or leave-it
contract to the auditors, the contract is accepted if its expected payoﬀ is greater than the outside
                           i
opportunity, denoted V for i = h, d, of the auditors. Each auditor will have a large number of
reports, randomly chosen, to audit. The expected payoﬀ from the contract is therefore given by:
                             Z
               Vei (w , η) =    V i (θ, s(θ), ei (s(θ)); w, η) f(θ) dθ,          for i = h, d.    (7)
                              Θ
Once inspectors accept the contract, the tax agency expects to collect the following amount from
a θ-taxpayer reporting m
 R(w, η; θ, m, ed (m), eh (m)) = (1 − η)T (m) − w + λ(1 − β)ed (m)φa (θ, m)
                                         £                      ¤
                                       + λ + β(1 − λ)eh (m) (u(θ, m) + φt (θ, m)) − βηeh (m)u(θ, m).
This revenue reflects the fact that the tax agency does not know whether the report will be audited
by a corruptible or honest inspector. The revenue is determined at equilibrium and depends on
the strategies adopted by the players. To compute the total expected revenue at equilibrium it
suﬃces to integrate over the whole population
                                     Z
                         R(w, η) =       R(w, η; θ, s(θ), ed (s(θ)), eh (s(θ)))f(θ)dθ.            (8)

"
"439","The tax agency solves the following program:
                                                                h                     d
              Maximizew,η R(w, η) subject to Veh (w, η) ≥ V        and Ved (w, η) ≥ V ,           (9)
to obtain the remuneration contract that maximizes total revenue under the ex ante participation
constraints of the auditors.
3     Equilibrium analysis
The preceding section described the diﬀerent actors of the economy and the way they interact.
This section determines of the equilibrium outcome of the overall game by backward induction.
First, the equilibrium of the signaling game is derived under the assumption that the auditors have
accepted the contract oﬀered by the tax agency. Afterwards, the optimal remuneration contract,
solution of the program (9), is computed. If both types of auditors accept the contract, a first
general result that holds true in this setting is the following:
Proposition 1 At equilibrium, for any report, the corruptible auditors exert a higher eﬀort than
                         ∗          ∗
the honest ones, i.e. ed (m) > eh (m) ∀m ∈ M.
    Proof: From (4) and (6) it is immediate that b(θ, m) − λφa (θ, m) > ηu(θ, m). Upon observing
the report m, the first order condition of the corruptible (resp. honest) auditors optimization
                                                  ∗                                      ∗
program is IEµ∗ (b(θ, m) − λφa (θ, m)) = ψ0 (ed (m)) (resp. ηIEµ∗ (u(θ, m)) = ψ0 (eh (m))). For
the equilibrium to fulfill the consistency requirement, both types of auditors must hold the same
                              ∗              ∗
beliefs µ∗ . Therefore, ψ0 (ed (m)) > ψ 0 (eh (m)); the result follows directly since ψ() is a convex
function.        ¥
    This result is quite intuitive. Indeed, in determining the optimal level of eﬀort, the auditors
equate the marginal cost of eﬀort to its expected marginal benefit. Since corruption is always
beneficial, the expected marginal benefit is always higher for the dishonest auditors. Therefore,
the corruptible auditors who foresee the possibility of extra illegitimate profit work harder to
obtain it.
                                                  12
"
"440","    The characterization of the equilibria would constitute a formidable task in such a general
specification. To get further insight on what’s going on, more restrictions need to be added.
Following most of the literature and consistent with existing penalty systems, the fine functions
are restricted to multiplicative functions of the evaded amount, i.e., φi (θ, m) = φi u(θ, m), with
φi > 0, for i = a, t. The bribe the evaders have to pay and their expected payoﬀ are then:
                                 1
                      b(θ, m) = ((1 − λ)(1 + φt ) + λφa + η)u(θ, m) = αu(θ, m),
                                 2
and
  U (θ, m; eh , ed ) = θ − T (θ) + {1 − (1 + φt )(λ + β a (1 − λ)eh (m)) − α(1 − β a )ed (m)}u(θ, m)
                     = θ − T (θ) + γ(m)u(θ, m).
At equilibrium, each individual is maximizing the premium from cheating given the auditors’
strategy. Thus, no taxpayer must gain by choosing the report of another type. This is the
incentive compatibility constraint found in the literature of games with asymmetric information.
The incentive compatibility approach to signaling games can be found in Mailath (1987) or Banks
(1990). One thus obtains the following condition:
                        γ(s(θ)) · u(θ, s(θ)) ≥ γ(s(θ0 )) · u(θ, s(θ 0 )) ∀ θ, θ0 ∈ Θ.             (10)
At equilibrium, if a θ-type chooses the action of a θ0 -type, the receiver does not perceive it as a
deviation, but instead only assigns the type θ0 to the sender. A direct implication of condition
(10) above is the following proposition (see the appendix for the proof)
Proposition 2 At any equilibrium, the taxpayers’ strategy is monotone increasing, i.e., ∀ θ, θ0 ∈
Θ, θ < θ 0 implies s(θ) ≤ s(θ 0 ).
    This proposition merely states that richer taxpayers will report higher incomes. The main
diﬃculty with signaling games is the multiplicity of equilibria, which dramatically reduces the
predictive power of the models and thus their usefulness. The plethora of equilibria is typical in
signaling games. This is because the concept of sequential equilibrium places almost no restrictions
                                                    13
"
"441","on the beliefs of the auditors for reports that must not be observed at a given equilibrium, i.e.,
out-of-equilibrium reports. The beliefs at such messages can take any conceivable form, and audi-
tors can have some unreasonable beliefs which will generate an infinity of equilibrium outcomes.
Many refinements that restrict the out-of-equilibrium beliefs to become reasonable, justifiable or
appropriate have been proposed in the literature in order to restore the predictive power of the
signaling models. The best known are the Never a Weak Best Response by Kohlberg and Mertens
(1986), the Intuitive Criterion by Cho and Kreps (1987) and the Universal Divinity (UD) concept
by Banks and Sobel (1987). This latter will be used in this paper, but the three criteria have
been shown to be equivalent in the type of game dealt with here, i.e., monotonic games, by Cho
and Sobel (1990). UD requires that for every out-of-equilibrium report auditors single out the
evader that is the “most” likely to defect from the equilibrium and put a probability one on such
a taxpayer. Fixing s(·), eh (·) and ed (·) auditors and taxpayers’ strategies in a sequential equilib-
rium, let us note by κ(θ, p|s, eh , ed ) the expected retained proportion of the evaded amount that
makes the θ-taxpayers indiﬀerent between reporting their equilibrium report m = s(θ) getting
their expected equilibrium payoﬀ, and making the out-of-equilibrium announcement p :
                                    κ(θ, p) · u(θ, p) = γ(m) · u(θ, m).                          (11)
                                                     0             0
Suppose the auditors adopt new strategies ed (·) and eh (·) such that γ 0 (p) > κ(θ, p), then the
taxpayer prefers to defect from the equilibrium by reporting p. For any equilibrium θ is said to be
more likely to defect to p than θ0 if κ(θ, p) < κ(θ 0 , p).
Definition 2 A universally divine equilibrium in our game is a sequential equilibrium in which
for any out-of-equilibrium report p, µ(θ|p) > 0 only if
                                θ ∈ Arg min   0
                                                κ(θ0 , p | s(·), eh (·), ed (·)).
                                            θ
    A zero probability is put on any type of evader breaking the equilibrium as long as there exists
another one who gains more by defecting from the supposed equilibrium. It is important to note
that the type most likely to defect can be singled out because we have multiplicative fine functions.
The taxpayers then act as if they had in front of them an “average” auditor, where the weights
                                                       14

"442","are the expected proportion of the evaded amount lost upon a successful audit by the tax agency,
an honest auditor or a corruptible auditor.
     According to proposition 2, the reporting strategies are increasing monotonically in any equi-
librium. Any discontinuity in the strategies is thus a jump discontinuity and there is a countable
number of them since the strategies must also be almost everywhere diﬀerentiable. One can thus
expect to have pooling, separating or hybrid equilibria. However, the following proposition ensures
that requiring the equilibrium to be universally divine, only separating equilibria, where the type
of the taxpayer is revealed, survive.
Proposition 3 In the signaling game played by the taxpayers and the auditors, only separating
equilibria meet the universal divinity requirement.
     The proof of this proposition is in the appendix. The same type of result is found in Hindriks
(1996) and Reinganum and Wilde (1986b).
3.1      The benchmark cases
Before turning to the analysis of the general game, it is useful to study the situation in which
the auditors are all honest (β = 1) or all dishonest (β = 0). While the moral hazard problem is
still relevant, there is no adverse selection in these cases since all the auditors are alike. Both the
equilibrium of the auditors/taxpayers signaling game and the optimal remuneration scheme are
                                                          h      d
characterized. It is assumed for the time being that V       = V = 0, i.e., all auditors have the same
reservation utility normalized at zero for the sake of simplicity.
3.1.1     Only honest auditors
Suppose first that all the auditors are honest (β = 1), i.e., whenever they discover a cheater, the
latter is denounced. The expected payoﬀ of an auditor who reviews a file with report m is given
by (1) to be maximized by eh∗ (m), while a θ-taxpayer chooses to report m = s∗ (θ) if it maximizes
the expected gain from misreporting
                               [1 − (1 + φt )(λ + (1 − λ)eh (m))]u(θ, m).
                                                   15
"
"443","It is straightforward to compute the first-order conditions of the diﬀerent players and derive an
equilibrium that resembles that of Reinganum and Wilde (1986a), where the audit probability is
a decreasing function of the report which is increasing in true income. However, since another
important purpose of the paper is to determine the optimal remuneration scheme, focus will be
placed on simple equilibria, as the one derived by Hindricks (1996), characterized by constant
audit eﬀort and evasion levels. Suppose the auditors decide to investigate each report with an
                         1−λ(1+φt )
intensity eh∗ (m) ≡     (1−λ)(1+φt )  ∀m ∈ M for all signals. This makes the taxpayers indiﬀerent
with respect to the report since their expected gain from cheating is constant and equals zero. To
obtain an equilibrium, it is assumed that the taxpayers adopt the strategy that is consistent with
that of the auditors. The latter’s expected payoﬀ is maximized at eh∗ if the first order condition
ψ0 (eh∗ ) = ηIEµ (u(θ, m)) holds. Since the equilibrium is separating, the beliefs are point beliefs and
for this condition to hold whatever the report, the evaded amount must be constant. Denoting
this amount by uh∗ , we must have uh∗ = ψ0 (eh∗ )/η. It will be shown that this equilibrium is
universally divine and can be sustained by appropriate beliefs.
    In this simple equilibrium, the auditors’ strategy is insensitive to both the remuneration scheme
and the penalty they face. The commission rate η aﬀects only the evasion decision, higher values
implying less evasion. From a report m, the inspectors in charge of such a file expect a payoﬀ of
w + ηT (m) + ηeh∗ uh∗ − ψ(eh∗ ). The overall expected payoﬀ from the contract (w, η) is given by
                                Veh∗ = w + ηT − (1 − eh∗ )ηuh∗ − ψ(eh∗ ),
while the tax agency expects to collect an amount of tax cum fines of
                     Rh∗ = (1 − η)T − w − ((1 − λ)(1 + φt ) − η)(1 − e∗ )u∗ + φt u∗
             R
where T =      Θ
                 T (θ)f (θ)dθ is the average true tax liability. What type of contract will the agency
propose to the auditors in order to maximize the collected amount? It is useful to rewrite the tax
agency revenue as a function of the auditors’ eﬀort and utility, the following way
                                        Rh∗ = T − ψ(eh∗ ) − Veh∗ .

"
"444","This expression makes clear that both the eﬀort exerted by the auditors and the utility they
derive from a given contract are wasteful for the agency. A straightforward consequence is that no
rent should be left to the employees, and the tax agency must propose a contract that will make
the participation constraint binding. For any 1 ≥ η > 0, it suﬃces to propose wh∗ (η) such that
Veh∗ ≡ 0. A straightforward computation gives:
                                                   Z  eh∗
                                      wh∗ (η) =           (1 − e)ψ00 (e)de − ηT.                                 (12)
                                                    0
It may well be that wh (η) < 0, meaning that the inspectors must pay for the right to collect
taxes. The optimal fixed wage to be paid depends on the commission rate only through the size
of the tax base. The higher the tax base the lower the wage. The tax agency always collects
Rh∗ = T − ψ(eh∗ ), the sole leakage with respect to the no-evasion case is the transfer that has to
be given to the auditors to compensate them for the disutility of eﬀort.
3.1.2    Only dishonest auditors
Suppose now that β = 0, i.e., all the auditors are prone to corruption whenever it is financially
beneficial. The focus will again be on simple equilibria. For the taxpayers to be indiﬀerent about
the report they make the probability of an audit must be ed∗ (m) ≡ (1 − λ(1 + φt ))/α ∀m ∈
M.2 Unlike the honest auditors, the corruptible ones choose their eﬀort level depending on the
remuneration scheme and the penalty system. The auditing eﬀort is decreasing with both the
commission and the penalty rates, i.e., ∂ed∗ /∂η < 0 and ∂ed∗ /∂φa < 0. For this strategy to be
an equilibrium strategy, the taxpayers must all evade the same amount ud∗ = ψ0 (ed∗ )/(α − λφa ).
Since corruption is profitable, it always takes place when an audit provides compelling evidence
   2 Recall that the audit eﬀort is also a probability, so to keep things within bounds, some restrictions need to be
added. It is easy to see that the condition we need for 0 ≤ ed∗ ≤ 1 is
                                            1 − η − λ(1 + φa )         1−λ
                                                               ≤ φt ≤         .

One can plot in the space (φa , φt ) the set in which that condition is satisfied. The remainder of the paper assumes
that the punishment rates belong to this set, denoted P.

"445","of evasion. The overall expected payoﬀ of an auditor from a contract (w, η) is then
                          Ved∗ = w + ηT − (η − (α − λφa )ed∗ )ud∗ − ψ(ed∗ ),
while the tax agency expects to collect
                Rd∗    = (1 − η)T − w − ((1 − λ)(1 + φt ) − η − λφa ed∗ )ud∗ + φt ud∗
                       = T − ψ(ed∗ ) − Ved∗
in taxes and fines. As in the preceding case, eﬀort and rent are costly to the agency which must
oﬀer its employees a contract that will leave them no rent equalizing their expected payoﬀ to the
value of their outside option. For a given commission rate η, there exists a fixed wage wd∗ (η)
such that the utility of the auditors is Ved∗ ≡ 0 and the agency collects Rd∗ = T − ψ(ed∗ ). Again,
the loss in tax collection corresponds to the amount that must be paid to the auditors for the
compensation of the audit eﬀort’s disutility. Notice that the revenue collected is lower with respect
to the case of honest auditors, since the dishonest ones work harder. It is easy to compute as
                                     Z   ed∗ (η) µ            ¶

Whether the auditors are all honest or all dishonest, the tax agency oﬀers a contract such that
for any commission the fixed wage is such that no rent is left to the auditors. If the auditors
are honest, all remuneration contracts provide the same revenue because the eﬀort level is fixed.
However, when the auditors are corruptible, the monitoring eﬀort, which determines the leakage in
revenue collected, depends on the commission rate. Therefore all the remuneration contracts are
not equivalent, unlike the full-honesty case. It is clear from the expression above that the revenue
collected is a decreasing function of the eﬀort exerted by the auditors, which is a decreasing function
of the commission rate. Therefore, the unique optimal remuneration contract is (1, wd∗ (1)), i.e.,
a commission of 100 percent associated with the fixed part which leads to full rent extraction
Ved ≡ 0. The tax agency therefore “privatizes” the collection of taxes; the revenue-maximizing
system when all auditors are corruptible is the pure tax-farming system.

"446","    The discussion in the last two sections can be subsumed in the following proposition:
Proposition 4 If all the tax inspectors are identical, the tax agency oﬀers a remuneration contract
(η, wi∗ (η)) for i = h, d such that:
  (a) the auditors accept the contract;
  (b) a triple (si∗ (·), ei∗ (·), µi∗ (·)) that is a universally divine sequential equilibrium is the outcome
       of the signaling game played by the taxpayers and auditors, with
         (i) si∗ (θ) = T −1 (T (θ) − ui∗ ) for all θ ∈ Θ and ui∗ > 0;
         (ii) ei∗ (m) = ei∗ for all m ∈ M, and 0 < ei∗ < 1;
         (iii) µi∗ (θ|m) = 1 for m = si∗ (θ), µi∗ (θ|p) = 1 for p < si∗ (θ) and µi∗ (θ|p) = 1 for
              p > si∗ (θ).
  (c) if the auditors are honest, all the contracts (η, wh∗ (η)) are equivalent;
  (d) if the auditors are dishonest pure tax farming (1, wd∗ (1)) is the unique revenue maximizing
       contract;
  (e) the revenue collected is greater when auditors are honest.
    Full rent extraction is possible in these benchmark cases because the tax agency has complete
information with respect to the integrity of its employees. The next section focuses on the case
where this no longer holds.
3.2      Heterogeneous inspectors
Let us now turn to the more interesting situation where the proportion of honest auditors working
in the tax agency is 0 < β < 1. The auditors are indistinguishable and only one remuneration
contract is oﬀered. The tax agency suﬀers now from information asymmetries. To derive the same
type of simple equilibria, the taxpayers have to be indiﬀerent, as in the preceding section, about
the report to make. The audit probabilities must then be such that γ(m) ≡ 0. More importantly
at such an equilibrium eh and ed that satisfy this condition must also be constant. Indeed, the
condition could hold while ∂ei /∂m < 0 < ∂ej /∂m for i, j = h, d and i 6= j. However, from the
first order conditions, the audit probabilities depend on the evaded amount and at equilibrium
the auditors have the same beliefs, therefore the audit intensities must be either both increasing
or both decreasing. In the (eh , ed ) plane, the equation γ(m) ≡ 0 is defined by a line pivoting
                                                   β  (1−λ)(1+φt )

order conditions for the honest and dishonest auditors are respectively ψ0 (eh ) = ηIEµ (u(θ, m)) and
ψ0 (ed ) = (α − λφa )IEµ (u(θ, m)). The beliefs are point beliefs and for these conditions to hold the

                        Γ(η) = ((eh , ed ), 0 ≤ eh , ed ≤ 1; such that γ = 0 .
The equilibrium audit eﬀorts pair is determined by the intersection of these two sets, i.e., (ēh (η), ēd (η)) =
Ψ(η) ∩ Γ(η). The set of equilibria is obtained by varying η in the interval [0,1]. It is straightfor-
ward to show that for a given set of parameters, there exists a unique intersection point, that
is a unique equilibrium. This equilibrium will be studied with reference to the benchmark cases.
For a given η, the equilibrium that arises in each of the latter cases has already been established.
If the same commission rate is adopted by the tax agency in the case of a mixture of honest and
dishonest auditors, two cases must be considered depending on whether the parameters of the
model imply uh∗ ≷ ud∗ .
     Case 1: uh∗ > ud∗ the evasion is greater when all auditors are honest. Suppose that ēh >
eh∗ then, to satisfy γ ≡ 0, it is necessary that ēd < ed∗ . However, uh∗ > ud∗ =⇒ ψ0 (ed∗ ) <
α−λφa 0 h∗
    η   ψ (e )  thus an increase in the level of eﬀort of the honest auditors and a decrease in that of
the dishonest ones cannot satisfy the conditions. Hence if uh∗ > ud∗ then ēh < eh∗ and ēd > ed∗ .
     Case 2: uh∗ < ud∗ the evasion is greater when all auditors are dishonest. The same reasoning
shows that if uh∗ < ud∗ then ēh > eh∗ and ēd < ed∗ .
     Using the same arguments, it is easy to show that the equilibrium level of evasion is in between
that of the two extreme cases, i.e., ū ∈ (ui∗ , uj∗ ) for i, j = h, d and i 6= j. It must be noted that
in case 1, one may encounter a non-existence of equilibrium problem. This comes from the fact
                                                      20
"
"448","that for some values of the parameters, one could have ēd > 1 while this never happens in case 2.
Indeed, in this latter case, the equilibrium eﬀort pair lies in the triangle ABC in figure 2, while
in case 1 it is at the north-west of point A. For high βs one could thus have no equilibrium since
the audit eﬀort required from the dishonest auditors is too high. Thus, in the remainder of this
paper, only case 2 is considered, the results being symmetric for case 1 whenever an equilibrium
exists. At this equilibrium, taxpayers evade less than if there were only dishonest auditors.

    The tax agency anticipates the equilibrium that will arise depending on the contract proposed
to the auditors. It will choose this contract to maximize the revenue collected. The auditors’
expected payoﬀ from a common contract (w, η) is
                                    h
                                   Ve = w + ηT − (1 − ēh )ηū − ψ(ēh )

than that of the honest ones. In fact, the following relationship between the auditors’ utility is

where the integral term is the extra utility the corruptible inspectors get; it is the informational

Again, the eﬀort exerted by the inspectors and the rent they are left with are costly to the
tax agency. Which remuneration scheme provides the greater tax cum fines collection? Both
honest and dishonest auditors’ participation constraints have to be respected in order to have an
equilibrium. It is clear that to maximize the revenue no rent should be left to the honest auditors.
                                                                                    h
Indeed, for η fixed, if w is such that at the equilibrium Ve > 0 it is possible to propose w0 < w
                  h
such that Ve = 0 that is accepted by all the auditors without changing the equilibrium outcome
and increase the revenue raised. The tax agency is bound to leave a rent to the dishonest auditors,
           d
i.e., Ve > 0 since otherwise the honest ones would not participate in the audit game and upset
the equilibrium. For a given commission rate η, the optimal fixed wage is thus w(η) that saturates
the honest auditors’ participation constraint and is given by
                                                       Z  ēh (η)

It has the same structure as the case β = 1 except that now the eﬀort depends on the commission
rate since it is linked with the eﬀort exerted by the dishonest auditors. The expected payoﬀ of
the honest auditors is equated to their outside option whereas the corruptible agents enjoy the

where for any commission rate no rent is left to the honest inspectors. The revenue loss with
respect to the full tax liability then amounts to the compensation of disutility of eﬀort for all the
auditors and the informational rent that has to be left to the corruptible agents only. The overall
optimal remuneration scheme is the one that minimizes this loss. It remains to characterize the
optimal commission rate which is the solution of the following program:
                                                                                   Z  ēd (η)
             η̄ ∈ Arg min L(η) = βψ(ēh (η)) + (1 − β)ψ(ēd (η)) + (1 − β)                    eψ00 (e)de. (16)
                        η                                                           ēh (η)
There is no problem of existence since the loss function is continuous and is minimized on a
compact interval. Even though the first-order condition is readily computed, it is of almost no use
because the expressions involved in this condition are rather complicated and identifying the local
minima is impossible within such a general framework. However, the tax agency can compute the
loss function for a fixed set of parameters and then determine the optimal commission rate. This
expression does not allow for establishing a unique optimal commission rate, but the important
fact is that in case of multiple solutions the collected revenue is the same and the tax agency is
indiﬀerent. To break the tie it is assumed that the agency chooses the contract that gives the
higher payoﬀ to the agents. All the parameters, the distribution of types β, the penalty system
(φa , φt ), and the probability of discovering the conspiracy λ play important roles on the optimal
remuneration contract.
Proposition 5 If the population of tax inspectors is heterogeneous, the tax agency oﬀers a single
remuneration contract (η, w(η)) such that:
 (a) the auditors accept the contract;
 (b) a quadruple (s̄(·), ēh (·), ēd (·), µ̄(·)) that is a universally divine sequential equilibrium is the
       outcome of the signaling game played by the taxpayers and auditors, with

4     Some possible extensions
In this section we examine the eﬀect on the equilibrium outcome of relaxing some assumptions
that have been made implicitly or explicitly.
Ex post participation constraint
By writing the participation constraint of the auditors in ex ante terms, an implicit assumption in
the analyses performed up to now is that the auditors can commit once hired to audit all reports
with the equilibrium audit intensity. This is however a very strong assumption since ex post, for
some low-income reports, the auditors have no incentive to audit (that intensively) anticipating
that for the fixed wage paid these files will bring a negative payoﬀ. The lack of commitment power
can overturn the equilibrium. We suppose now that the auditors cannot (in fact have no incentive
to) commit to audit all the files. The participation constraint then has to be satisfied for any
report.4 Formally, this condition can be written as
                      w + ηT (m) + ηeh (m)IEµ (u(θ, m)) − ψ(eh (m)) ≥ 0 ∀m ∈ M
for the honest auditors and
                 w + ηT (m) + (α − λφa )ed (m)IEµ (u(θ, m)) − ψ(eh (m)) ≥ 0 ∀m ∈ M
for the corruptible ones. These equations must hold for any considered equilibrium. For the simple
equilibria we are interested in here, they will be simplified. Indeed, since the evasion levels are
the same, it is enough that the constraints be fulfilled and binding for the lower report in the
   4 This is also a kind of limited liability constraint that has to be respected for any state of the nature (file to
audit here), not only on average.

"
"452","diﬀerent scenarios considered. The necessity of taking into account the ex post incentives for the
auditors to inspect translates into a cost for the tax agency. Indeed, by inducing the auditors to
commit ex ante, the tax agency is shifting all the risk on the shoulders of these latter who on any
report m bear a risk of η(T (θ) − T), where θ is the true income of the taxpayers reporting m. One
clearly sees that on average the risk is zero and the auditors are induced to sign the contract ex
ante. However, the auditors loose money ex post (if they audit) on all taxpayers whose income is
below the mean. Now if the auditors refuse to bear this risk, the agency must pay them enough to
audit all reports. One can then show that the cost, for the tax agency, of the lack of commitment
from the inspectors to the audit strategy is independent of the distribution of honest/dishonest
inspectors and equal to CNC = η(T − T (θ). For a given commission rate, the fixed wage has to
be set such that the inspector gains to audit the report, whatever it is. Since only equilibria in
which the evasion level (audit eﬀort) is independent of the true income (reported income) are
investigated here, we must have
                                 w + η(T (θ) − u) + ηeh u − ψ(eh ) = 0
for the honest auditor and the analogous expression for the corruptible ones. The fixed wage
is computed from the above equation and the diﬀerence between it and the one that has to be
paid in the commitment case gives the cost of impossibility of commitment. Repeating the same
operations for all the scenarios shows that it is always the same and independent of the distribution
of the auditors’ types in the pool.
    The introduction of ex post individual rationality constraints has very important implications
for the optimal remuneration scheme, since the cost it induces directly relates to the commission
rate. When all the auditors are honest (β = 1), we have already shown that from an ex ante point
of view, the rate is irrelevant since the same tax revenue can be achieved for any of its possible
values by adjusting the fixed wage. Now, the rate must be taken into account since higher rates
imply higher costs to be borne, and less revenue. The optimal remuneration scheme is in this
                                                    25
"
"453","case the pure wage system which sets η = 0. We do not consider this possibility in our model,
then η will be fixed at its lowest possible (maybe chosen by a regulatory agency) level. If on the
other hand the auditors are all corruptible (β = 0), the tax agency faces a trade-oﬀ between the
cost stemming from the lack of commitment power and those induced by a high level of auditing
eﬀort due to low commission rates. One can write the revenue in the no-commitment case as
Rd∗              d∗
  NC = T − ψ(e ) − η(T − T (θ). The optimal commission rate is
                                 η nc = Arg min ψ(ed∗ (η)) + η(T − T (θ)).
                                             η
The first-order condition is easily derived and the optimal rate is such that the marginal benefit of
reducing η, (T − T (θ) stemming from the reducing of the no-commitment cost equals its marginal
cost, [1 − λ(1 + φt )]ψ0 (ed∗ (η))/2α2 stemming from the increase in eﬀort that must be monetarily
compensated. Taking into account ex post incentives, the tax agency switches from a pure tax-
farming system to an intermediate system if the solution to the above minimization program is
interior and a pure wage system otherwise.
    In the case 0 < β < 1 the results are harder to obtain since the optimal commission rate
has not been fully characterized. The tax agency still faces the same trade-oﬀ between the cost
induced by the loss function and that of no-commitment. One can however show that the latter
cost reduces the level of the previous commission rate, i.e., η̄nc ≤ η̄ with
                                    η̄nc = Arg min L(η) + η(T − T (θ)).                           (17)
                                                η
Indeed, either both are corner solutions, i.e. η̄ = 0, and η̄nc = 0, or η̄ > 0 and the introduction of
a new cost that is linearly increasing in the commission rate forcefully leads to η̄nc < η̄.
Integrity-dependent reservation utility
Since the inspectors are alike except for the integrity parameter, it is reasonable to assume, as
we did, that they have the same set of opportunities outside the tax agency. However, does this
imply that they have the same reservation utility? It could be that the corruptible agents can
                                                    26
"
"454","take an advantage from their dishonesty for any other job, as they do in the agency, and thus
have greater reservation utilities than the honest ones. In any case, it is assumed now that the
                                                                          i
inspectors have type-dependent reservation utilities. Denote by V > 0 for i = h, d the outside
options. In the cases β = 1 or β = 0, the tax agency takes into account this rent to be paid and
increases the fixed wage by the value of the new reservation utility. The only thing that changes
is the revenue collected, which is lowered. At equilibrium, the optimal remuneration schemes are
the same and this holds for both commitment and no-commitment cases.
    The interesting case is 0 < β < 1 when a mix of auditors are hired. Changing the reservation
utility has no eﬀect on the optimal commission rate since it is suﬃcient to increase the fixed wage
until all participation constraints are met. The fixed wage being essentially a lump-sum transfer,
this operation does not aﬀect the equilibrium, except for the revenue collected. The relevant
                                                                                         d    h
question for the tax agency is whether the diﬀerence in reservation utilities V = V −V is greater,
equal or less than the informational rent the dishonest auditors enjoy at the equilibrium where
                                 R ēd
outside options are alike, IR =   ēh
                                       eψ00 (e)de. Since the participation constraint of the honest is still
                                                               h
required, the fixed wage has to be increased at least by V . If V = IR, then by increasing the fixed
                    h
wage by exactly V     both the honest and dishonest auditors’ individual rationality constraints are
binding and the tax agency loses nothing more. In this case, the corruptible inspectors lose their
informational rent since the gap between the reservation utilities has been used as a substitute for
it. If V < IR, then the honest agents’ participation constraint is binding and the dishonest still
                                                                                                          h
receive a smaller rent since they lose part, and exactly V , of their rent. If V > IR, then giving V
is not enough to meet the participation constraint of the corruptible, the tax agency must then
                               h                       h                d
increase the fixed wage by V      + δ such that V        + δ + IR = V . Now the honest agents enjoy
an informational rent since their utility is higher than their outside option, by δ, while for the
dishonest one the constraint is binding. In conclusion, when the reservation utilities are diﬀerent,
the tax agency uses the gap as a perfect substitute for the informational rent that had to be given
to the dishonest auditors who lose in this situation, the winners being the honest agents who in
                                                      27

"455","some situations earn more than expected. The greater V , the better oﬀ they are.
The employment contract as a signal
Up to now, we have considered the tax agency’s revenue maximization problem as an ex post
problem since the maximization is done under the constraint that the staﬀ is already in place
and all the auditors have to participate. It could be the case that the agency does not desire
corrupt (or honest) individuals on its staﬀ and could thus propose a contract that would allow
for screening the auditors who self select according to the contract proposed. In fact, it is more
realistic to think that in order to hire the inspectors, the agency has to propose, to a pool of
skilled but unemployed auditors, a contract that is publicly observed ex ante. Those who are then
interested will apply for employment. This is important since it conditions the equilibrium that
will arise. Indeed, the public contract constitutes a signal for the taxpayers. Upon the proposal of
the contract, one can infer which type of auditors it will attract. It is important to notice that in
our model, the argument according to which eﬃciency wage deters corruption does not have any
bite. In fact, corruption in this context depends only on equation (4); as long as (4) is satisfied
the corruptible inspectors and the evaders will collude whenever they meet, irrespective of the
remuneration scheme. Corruption is thus “structural” and depends on the penalty system.
     A direct implication is that no contract exists that will attract only honest agents. Whenever
the honest agents are attracted by a contract, it also attracts the dishonest. The adverse selection
problem is quite harsh. On the other hand, there are contracts that will attract corruptible agents
and repel honest ones.5         The set of contracts can be represented in the space (w, η) which is
partitioned into three regions:
  (a) {(w(η), η), such that w(η) ≥ w(η)};
  (b) {(w(η), η), such that wd (η) ≤ w(η) < w(η)};
   5 Note here the analogy with the theory of insurance with adverse selection where any pooling contract, as the
one proposed here (abstracting from the budget balance constraint), leads to an equilibrium with either only bad
risk agents or both types accepting the contract. We do consider here neither the possibility nor the optimality of
oﬀering diﬀerent employment contracts that will induce the collectors to self select.
                                                       28
"
"456","  (c) {(w(η), η), such that w(η) < wd (η)}.
    Recall that w(η) is the fixed wage that makes the honest auditors’ participation constraint
binding if the agency staﬀ is mixed, and wd (η) is the one that just induces the corruptible agents
to accept the contract when β = 0. The contracts that belong to region (a) attract both the
honest and the corruptible agents, in region (b) only dishonest auditors will apply for employment
while nobody is willing to work for contracts that lie in (c). The latter contracts can never be
optimal for the tax agency because they imply too much evasion. Even though the distribution
of the pool is (β, 1 − β), the distribution of the auditors hired by the tax agency is endogenous to
the contract oﬀered and the agency has the choice between (β, 1 − β) where the contract attracts
both types of auditors and (0, 1) that only attract dishonest auditors. One can show that in case 1
w(η) > wd (η) for all η ∈ [0, 1]. We have been unable to show it for case 2. If this condition were not
to be satisfied in a region, then the agency loses the choice since in this region any wage attracting
the dishonest auditors also attracts the honest ones. The tax agency now chooses the contract that
will bring the highest expected revenue. At this end, it needs to compare the contracts in region
(a) to those in region (b) and select the optimal one. For a given commission rate η the agency
will oﬀer w(η) if L(η) ≤ ψ(ed∗ (η) and wd (η) otherwise. Surprisingly, there may be cases in which
the tax agency does not want to hire honest auditors. The reason for this counterintuitive result
is the following. Even though an honest inspector brings, in expected terms, more revenue than
a dishonest one, because they denounce the cheaters, mixing them with the dishonest creates the
adverse selection problem. The tax agency can thus prefer to oﬀer contracts that will attract only
the dishonest auditors, eliminating by the same token the adverse selection problem. This latter
being suppressed, the moral hazard problem can be handled more eﬃciently and the contracts
will be chosen to leave no costly rents to the dishonest. This is a kind of capitulation wage as
proposed by Besley and McLaren (1993); however, the argument is much more complex.
    Let us now show that w(η) > wd (η) in case 1. Using equations (12) and (14) and the first-order

earlier ed∗ (η) > ēh (η) for all η. In case 2, one must compare these two expressions and depending
on which one dominates the analysis may or may not hold.
5     Concluding remarks
The main purpose of this paper has been to analyze the problem of a tax agency that wants to
maximize its tax receipts in an environment where corruption is pervasive. The tax agency needs
to employ inspectors to audit taxpayers and collect taxes. Inspectors can be either honest or
dishonest and the only way the agency can influence their behavior is through the remuneration
contract it oﬀers. It transpires from the analysis that when all inspectors are prone to corruption
pure tax-farming is the unique revenue maximizing contract whereas all contracts are equivalent
when auditors are all honest. If in contrast the population of inspectors comprises both honest
and dishonest inspectors, the tax agency has to propose a contract that lies between pure tax-
farming and pure wage contract. For any chosen commission rate, the fixed wage component of
the contract must be adjusted to extract all the rent of the honest tax inspectors. In the presence
of honest auditors, the agency is unable to extract the rent of its corruptible agents. When
the tax administration has the possibility to oﬀer screening remuneration contracts during the
hiring process, it may be optimal to oﬀer capitulation wage contracts that attract only corruptible
auditors. As surprising as it might seem, this result is rooted in a firm intuition. Indeed, the
tax agency is facing a moral hazard as well as an adverse selection problem; a capitulation wage
oﬀer evacuates the latter problem and deals eﬃciently with the remaining moral hazard issue
afterwards.
    There are a number of directions in which this work can be fruitfully extended. First, while
                                                     30
"
"458","it is reasonable to assume diﬀerent degrees of integrity within the population of auditors, to
assume all taxpayers are dishonest seems artificial. A more satisfactory model would also allow
a fraction of taxpayers to be inherently honest following Erard and Feinstein (1994). However,
this seemingly minor change dramatically complicates the model. The first important implication
of the introduction of honest taxpayers is the unsustainability of simple equilibria with constant
evasion amount (for dishonest taxpayers) and constant audit probability. Indeed, suppose instead
an equilibrium with ēh (m) = ēh and ēd (m) = ēd implying γ(m) = γ ≥ 0 ∀m ∈ M. All the
dishonest taxpayers will then evade the same amount ū and the wealthiest dishonest taxpayer
reports m̄ = T −1 (T (θ) − ū) while the honest θ-taxpayer with θ ∈ [m̄, θ] report truthfully. For such
reports, since there is no gain in auditing, all the inspectors want to reduce the audit probability
to zero. In anticipation, some high-income dishonest taxpayers will report in the above interval
upsetting the equilibrium. This simple reasoning holds for any constant audit function. The
incorporation of honest taxpayers forces us to study more complex equilibria of the type derived
by Reinganum and Wilde (1986a) or Erard and Feinstein(1994) with decreasing audit functions.
This renders the analysis of the optimal remuneration scheme a formidable task. We leave this
question open for future research.
    Another interesting extension would be to consider the whole four-tier hierarchy by considering
an active government that chooses the income tax schedule and penalty system to maximize its
objective function. However, the government and the tax agency may have conflicting objectives,
the former aiming at maximizing social welfare and the latter caring only about tax revenues.
Such problems are dealt with in Cremer et al. (1990) and Sanchez and Sobel (1993). These
papers do not however consider the corruption problem. This will also raise the problem of the
distributional impact of evasion cum corruption, and the government will have to carefully choose
the tax schedule in order to achieve its objective. As we have shown, the tax agency’s resources
are greater when the penalty system supports the eradication of corruption, which could also lead
to a higher social welfare. However, one can easily imagine situations in which it is optimal from
                                                   31
"
"459","a social welfare perspective to allow some corruption in order to increase the well-being of the
auditors or to impose some restrictions on the remuneration scheme such as the non-negativity of
the fixed wage, precluding by the same token its abusive use by the tax agency as an instrument
for the extraction of the inspectors’ rent.
    Finally, it has been assumed that costs of appeal to a court are so low that there is no fear
of extortion. However, there is compelling evidence that such practices exist especially in the
developing countries where taxpayers are often victims of harassment from the inspectors, see
Klitgaard (1988) and Hindriks et al. (1999). The latter formally introduce extortion in their model
as the possibility for the inspector to unilaterally overstate a taxpayer’s liability. Tax farming has
appeared to be optimal in some situations in this paper. It would be interesting to see whether this
result is overturned once extortion is possible, because of a weak judiciary system, and because the
government cares about the well-being of the individuals. The latter must be protected against
overzealous inspectors, and this is costly since the planner has to engage resources to monitor the
inspectors’ behavior as argued by Stella (1993).

"460","Appendix
Proof of proposition 2:
     The same line of proof as that in Banks (1990) is followed. The honest taxpayers’ strategy is trivially
monotone increasing since sh (θ) = θ. Suppose that sd (·) is not monotone increasing, so that ∃θ, θ0 such
that θ < θ0 but sd (θ) > sd (θ 0 ), since overreporting is never optimal we have θ > sd (θ). One can rewrite
(10) as
                                                 γ(sd (θ))        u(θ, sd (θ0 ))

Diﬀerentiating the rhs of this expression while holding sd (θ) and sd (θ0 ) constant gives
                                    ∂u(θ,sd (θ 0 ))                     ∂u(θ,sd (θ))
                           ∂[·]          ∂θ

By the properties of the function u(·, ·), the numerator is negative while the denominator is positive. The
rhs of our rewritten incentive compatibility condition is thus decreasing with θ. It then implies that
                                      γ(sd (θ))          u(θ, sd (θ0 ))     u(θ0 , sd (θ0 ))

which in turn implies that γ(sd (θ))u(θ0 , sd (θ)) > γ(sd (θ0 ))u(θ0 , sd (θ0 )) contradicting the assumption that
sd (·) is an equilibrium strategy.                  ¥
Proof of proposition 3: The objective is to show how the universal divinity criterion of Banks and
Sobel eliminates all pooling and partially pooling equilibria of the game. Let us first identify the type
most likely to defect from a given equilibrium with reporting strategy s(·). We have
                                                                       γ(sd (θ))u(θ, sd (θ))

where p is the out-of-equilibrium report observed. Diﬀerentiating this expression with respect to θ, one
obtains:

The first term in the numerator of the first equation is simplified by the fact that at equilibrium the
strategy is incentive compatible. The last equation is derived from the second by making use of the
properties of the function u(·, ·) which is separable. The sign of the derivative allows to identify the
type most likely to defect to p and depends on the position of p. Suppose first that the equilibrium is
                                                                   ∗

never optimal. Let p be an out-of-equilibrium message, ∂κ/∂θ is negative (resp. positive), the type most
likely to defect is θ (resp. θ) and universal divinity requires µ(θ|p) = 1 (resp. µ(θ|p) = 1) for p greater
(resp. less) than m∗ . Suppose the θ-taxpayer chooses to separate by sending the message m = m∗ − ²
for ² positive and small. She then evades a little bit more but still less than the pooled average. Both
the honest and corruptible auditors expected gain from auditing m is lower than that from auditing m∗ ,
hence the separating taxpayer faces a lower probability and a higher expected payoﬀ(for ² small enough)
and will thus separate and break the pooling equilibrium. Repeating the same argument, the semi-pooling
equilibria are also eliminated.        ¥

                      MOVING BEYOND DETERRENCE
Adams‘ book (1993) begins with the inscription found over the entrance to the Internal
Revenue Service building: ―Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society‖. An essential
question for policymakers is the extent to which individuals are willing to pay this price.
The state-building process in post-communist societies and state-maintaining element
requires the collection and the use of revenues. Over the last several decades, there has
been a growing interest in theoretical, empirical, and experimental work on all aspects of
tax compliance and tax evasion. A common theme in much of this work is that the
traditional economics-of-crime approach to compliance, while containing many insights,
is simply inadequate as a framework for more fully understanding why people pay taxes.
Rather, the basic model of individual choice must be expanded by introducing some
aspects of behavior or motivation considered explicitly by other social sciences. Many of
these aspects can be discussed under the general rubric of ―behavioral economics‖,
broadly defined as an approach that uses methods and evidence from other social
sciences to inform the analysis of individual and group decision making. This report
represents an attempt to review exactly this new framework of compliance: one that
moves beyond the ―economics of crime‖ perspective, one that provides a more complete
understanding of individual (and group) decisions, and one that is more consistent with
empirical evidence. In general, the effect of cultural or social norms and of social capital
on tax compliance behavior is not well understood and addressing this gap is the focus of
the present research report.
        It is useful from the start to identify more fully the basic insight – and the basic
problem – with the standard economic approach to compliance. To date, the basic
theoretical model used in nearly all research on tax compliance begins with Becker‘s
(1968) economics-of-crime model first applied to tax compliance by Allingham and
Sandmo (1972). Here a rational individual is viewed as maximizing the expected utility
of the tax evasion gamble, by weighing the benefits of successful cheating against the
risky prospect of detection and punishment. Through this process, an outcome is reached
                                                                                           2

"467","where the individual pays taxes because he or she is afraid of getting caught and
penalized if he or she does not report all income. The obvious policy implication here is
that enforcement matters because enforcement can affect the financial considerations that
motivate – at least in part – an individual‘s compliance choices. However, it is essential
to recognize that this approach also concludes that an individual pays taxes because - and
only because - of the economic consequences of detection and punishment. Again, this is
a plausible and productive insight, with the obvious implication that the government can
encourage greater tax compliance by increasing the audit and the penalty rates. The
many extensions of this economics-of-crime approach considerably complicate the
theoretical analyses, and generally render clear-cut analytical results impossible.
Nevertheless, these extensions retain the basic approach and result: individuals focus
exclusively on the financial incentives of the evasion gamble, and individuals pay taxes
solely because they fear detection and punishment.
        However, it is clear to many observers that compliance cannot be explained
entirely by such purely financial considerations, especially those generated by the level of
enforcement. The percentage of individual income tax returns that are subject to a
thorough tax audit is generally quite small in most countries, tallying less than 1 percent
of all returns. Similarly, the penalty on even fraudulent evasion seldom exceeds more
than the amount of unpaid taxes, and these penalties are infrequently imposed; civil
penalties on non-fraudulent evasion are even smaller. Taxpayer audits are a central
feature of the voluntary compliance system in all countries, largely because more
frequent audits are thought to reduce tax evasion. Even so, a purely economic analysis of
the evasion gamble suggests that most rational individuals should either underreport
income not subject to source withholding or over-claim deductions not subject to
independent verification because it is extremely unlikely that such cheating will be
caught and penalized. However, even in the least compliant countries evasion never rises
to levels predicted by a purely economic analysis, and in fact there are often substantial
numbers of individuals who apparently pay all (or most) of their taxes all (or most) of the
time, regardless of the financial incentives they face from the enforcement regime.
        The basic model of individual compliance behavior therefore implies that rational
individuals (especially those whose incomes are not subject to third-party sources of
                                                                                           3

"468","information) should report virtually no income. Although compliance varies significantly
across countries and tax regimes and is often quite low, compliance seldom falls to a
level predicted by the standard economic theory of compliance. It seems implausible that
government enforcement activities alone can account for these levels of compliance; the
basic model is certainly unable to explain this behavior. Indeed, the puzzle of tax
compliance behavior may well be why people pay taxes, not why they evade them
(Slemrod, 1992; Kirchler, 2007; Torgler, 2007a; Alm, Martinez-Vazquez, and Torgler,
2010). This observation suggests that the compliance decision must be affected in ways
not fully captured by the basic economics-of-crime approach. But what are the reasons
behind this puzzle of tax compliance? The literature in the last couple of years has
stressed that the social norm of compliance or tax morale may help to explain why people
willingly conform. If tax morale is a key determinant in enhancing tax compliance there
are a variety of policies besides coercion that will help to reduce tax fraud. To derive
policy recommendation from these results it is necessary to go a step further and explore
the determinants of tax morale. Thus, an increasing number of studies have explored the
factors that shape tax morale in an attempt to gain a broader understanding of this issue
(see, e.g., Torgler, 2007a). However, there is still a lack of empirical evidence on the link
between attitudes and behaviour in the tax compliance literature. It is important to
address this deficiency because the state and the tax administration have a variety of
methods available to influence tax compliance; traditional approaches such as deterrence
can be seen as just one possible instrument. Historical examples also indicate that states
―can be strong with regards to specific capacities, for instance coercion and repression,
without ―producing‖ voluntary compliance, a phenomenon to be observed in many
transition countries... This also means that they are weak with regard to their political
capacity to rely on voluntary compliance‖ (Hayoz and Hug, 2007, p. 9). Thus, knowledge
about the causes and consequences of tax morale could lead to a better tax policy through
better voluntary compliance.
                                                                                            4

"469","     II. THE IMPACT OF TAX MORALE ON TAX COMPLIANCE
                         1. Overview and Theoretical Considerations
Since the 1990s, the issue of tax morale has increasingly attracted attention. The question
of why so many people pay their taxes, despite low fine and audit probabilities, has
become a central issue in the tax compliance literature. Erard and Feinstein (1994) stress
the relevance of integrating moral sentiments into the models to provide a reasonable
explanation of actual compliance behaviour. Assessing the literature, Andreoni, Erard
and Feinstein (1998) also point out that ―adding moral and social dynamics to models of
tax compliance is as yet a largely undeveloped area of research‖ (p. 852). Many
researchers maintain that a considerable portion of taxpayers are always honest. There are
some taxpayers who are ―simply predisposed not to evade‖ (Long and Swinger, 1991, p.
130) and thus do not even search for ways to cheat at taxes (see Frey, 1999).
Furthermore, Elffers (2000) reasons that not everyone with ―an inclination to dodge his
taxes is able to translate his intention into action‖ (p. 187). Many individuals do not have
the opportunity or the knowledge and resources to evade. Frey and Schneider (2000)
point out that moral costs could act as a disincentive to be active in the illegal sector: ―A
good citizen has moral qualms to undertake a forbidden activity. These moral costs are
closely related to ‗tax morale,‘ which motivates citizens to pay their dues to the state‖ (p.
6). An increase in tax morale increases the moral costs of behaving illegally and therefore
reduces the incentives to evade taxes. Spicer and Lundstedt (1976) claim that the choice
between tax compliance and evasion is not only made on the grounds of sanctions but
also on the grounds of a set of attitudes and norms. Lewis (1982) contends ―it could be
that tax evasion is the only channel through which taxpayers can express their antipathy
… we can be confident in our general prediction that if tax attitudes become worse, tax
evasion will increase‖ (p. 165, 177).
        Polinsky and Shavell (2000), who present a survey of the economic theory of
public enforcement of law, draw attention to the issue of social norms for future research.
Social norms can be seen as a general alternative to law enforcement in channeling
individuals‘ behavior. The violation of social norms has consequences including internal
                                                                                            5
"
"470","sanctions (guilt, remorse) or external legal and social sanctions such as gossip and
ostracism. Polinsky and Shavel (2000) explain that there is an expanding literature on
social norms because of their influence on behavior, their role as a substitute for and
supplement to formal laws and the possibility that laws themselves can influence social
norms.
        In literature we find interesting theories that enable us to integrate moral
constraints in a rational taxpayer model. One theory taking an altruistic approach (e.g.,
Chung 1976), involves taxpayers who are not only interested in their own welfare but are
also concerned with societal welfare. The decision to evade is constrained by the
knowledge that their evasion will reduce the amount of resources available for social
welfare. Another theory is the ‗Kantian‘ morality approach (see Laffont, 1975; Sugden,
1984). This methodology is broadly related to Kant‘s definition of morality and is based
on the assumption that a fair tax is a tax which a taxpayer believes to be fair for all other
taxpayers to pay. A false declaration will generate anxiety, guilt or a reduction in the
taxpayer‘s self-image. It is assumed that a taxpayer only experiences these detrimental
effects if he believes that his tax share is lower than what is defined as fair. If he is paying
a higher amount, evasion can be seen as a sort of self-defense.
        Erard and Feinstein (1994) incorporate shame and guilt directly into the
taxpayer‘s utility. They hypothesize that a taxpayer feels guilty when he under-reports
and escapes detection yet conversely also feels ashamed when he under-reports and gets
caught. Gordon (1989) modifies the standard model by including non-pecuniary costs of
evasion. He appeals to the literature on social customs (see Akerlof, 1980; Naylor, 1989)
to provide a reason why utility loss can be incurred by the act of evading. Non-pecuniary
or psychic cost increases as evasion increases, and Gordon develops a model which can
explain why some taxpayers refuse a favorable evasion game. Furthermore, dishonesty is
endogenized as reputation cost. Non-pecuniary costs have a dynamic component, varying
inversely with the number of individuals having evaded in the previous period.
Interestingly, there is a stable interior equilibrium where evaders and honest individuals
coexist. However, non-pecuniary costs are exogenous to the analysis so that they can
rationalize, but not explain, differences in tax behavior across consumers or social
groups.
                                                                                               6
"
"471","         Myles and Naylor (1996) state that the model developed by Gordon is a step
forward but lies outside the mainstream of the social custom literature because psychic
costs depend on the extent of evasion. They see no reason why such a relation should
hold. They argue that if the psychic cost is due to the shame at prosecution then the extent
of evasion is irrelevant. If it is due to the fear of detection, then it should be dependent on
the detection probability rather than the extent of evasion. Based on the social custom
literature where it is accepted that once a social custom is broken, all utility from it is
lost, Myles and Naylor suggest a model in which a social custom utility is derived when
taxes are paid honestly, but is lost when evasion is undertaken. In their model, taxpayers
face a choice between evading or not. If a taxpayer chooses evasion, the standard model
of tax evasion becomes operative. Myles and Naylor combine social customs and social
conformity with the standard model which represents tax evasion as a choice with risk.
Since then, further studies have also modeled this puzzle of tax compliance (see, e.g.,
Schnellenbach, 2010).
                                 2. Measurement of Tax Morale
Several studies have used the World Values Survey (WVS) to generate a proxy for tax
morale (see Torgler, 2007a). The World Values Survey is a worldwide investigation of
socio-cultural and political change collecting comparative data on values and belief
systems among people around the world. WVS builds on the European Values Surveys
(EVS), first carried out in 1981-1984. These surveys have assessed the basic values and
beliefs of people around the world and have been carried out in about 80 societies
representing over 80 per cent of the world‘s population. This large data set therefore
permits cross-country comparison of people‘s tax morale that is based on representative
national samples The WVS/EVS is particularly advantageous to this review because it
covers a large set of Central Eastern and Former Soviet Union countries. Not only does
the WVS/EVS pertain to a wide variety of religions and cultural traditions within each
country, but it can assist an analysis of value changes over time. The WVS has been
broadly used by social scientists.
To assess the level of tax morale the following question has been used:
                                                                                              7
"
"472","        ―Please tell me for each of the following statements whether you think it can always be
        justified, never be justified, or something in between: … Cheating on tax if you have the
        chance‖. The question leads to a ten scale index of tax morale with the two extreme
        points ―never justified‖ and ―always justified‖.
A second important data set that has been used is the Latinobarómetro (Torgler, 2005a).
It is an annual public opinion survey carried out in 17 Latin American countries (since
1996). It reports the opinions, attitudes, and behaviors of the around 400 million
inhabitants of the region. The survey started with 8 countries in 1995 and was extended to
17 countries in 1996. It covers most of Latin America with the exception of Cuba, the
Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. This data set is not as well known as the WVS
though economists have referred to it recently (see, e.g., Graham and Pettinato, 2002,
who contributed to the happiness research). This data set has integrated a similar question
which allows to measure tax morale:
        ―On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means not at all justifiable and 10 means totally
        justifiable, how justifiable do you believe it is to: Manage to avoid paying all his tax‖.
In addition some studies have worked with the International Social Survey Programme
(ISSP) (see, e.g., Torgler, 2005b). Similar to the previous data sets, it is a continuing
annual program of cross-national collaboration. It started in 1983 and has grown to
include more than 30 nations (mostly European countries). The RELIGION II (ISSP
1998) module covers, e.g., the following question:
        ―Do you feel it is wrong or not wrong if a taxpayer does not report all of his or her
        income in order to pay less income taxes? (1= not wrong, 2= a bit wrong, 3= wrong,
        4=seriously wrong)‖.
In general, these three data sets have the advantage that they are designed as a wide-
ranging survey, which reduces the probability of being suspicious and of creating framing
effects by other tax context questions.
                                                                                                   8
"
"473","         Some studies have also analyzed the Taxpayer Opinion Survey (TOS), data
collected in the United States in 1987 and providing a broad set of taxpayers‘ opinions
and evaluations of aspects as the tax system, the Internal Revenue Service, tax evasion,
cheating on taxes etc. The TOS offers the possibility to separately analyze two
determinants of tax evasion, overstating of deduction or expenses and underreporting
income, as dependent variables. Furthermore, it allows for the possibility of developing
different tax morale variables to check the robustness of the results. Unfortunately, the
TOS has not been used by many researchers (see, e.g., Smith, 1992; Sheffrin and Triest,
1992). Even if the data set is quite old, the huge amount of questions and the fact that not
many papers have used the data set, makes it attractive for newer research projects (see,
e.g., Forest and Sheffrin, 2002; Torgler, Demir, Macintyre and Schaffner, 2008; Torgler,
Schaffner, and Macintyre, 2010). Furthermore, the TOS has not been conducted post
1990.
         In general, extracting only a single question from the WVS also reduces
complexity problems inherent with the construction of an index, especially regarding the
measurement procedure or a low correlation between the items. Even so, one should
recognize that there are some good reasons to use a multi-item index instead of a single
question to measure tax morale.2 Tax morale is likely to be a multi-dimensional concept,
which may require a multi-item measurement tool, as in psychometric studies. In this
context, a single-item measure like ours has some disadvantages compared to a multi-
item index (Lewis, 1982; Jackson and Milliron, 1986). For example, a single-item
measure may have difficulty in capturing adequately the interrelated facets of tax morale,
and may also be adversely affected by random errors in measurement. Further, a multi-
item index has the advantage that errors should tend to average out, therefore producing a
more reliable measure. Compared to a single-item measure, a multi-item index likely
provides better score reliability by pooling together information that the items have in
common; a multi-item tool also increases validity by providing a more representative
sample of information about the underlying concept, and it increases precision by
2
  For example, Kirchler (1997, 1999) uses several items to measure tax morale. He confronted subjects
with various scenarios, in which a fictitious individual overspends/underreports income on a tax return.
After reading the scenarios, subjects could express their disagreement with or acceptance of tax evasion.
                                                                                                          9
"
"474","decreasing score variability. Torgler, Schaffner, and Macintyre (2010), e.g., have used an
index that covers the following questions to be able to measure tax morale:
        1. Given present tax burdens, one can hardly blame tax evaders.
        2. Given the easy availability of opportunities to evade taxes, one can hardly
            blame tax evaders.
        3. If in doubt about whether or not to report a certain source of income, I would
            not report it.
        4. Since the government gets enough taxes, it does not matter that some people
            evade taxes.
        5. Taxes are so heavy that tax evasion is an economic necessity for many to
            survive.
        6. If I receive $2000 in cash for services rendered, I would not report it.
        7. Cheating on taxes is justifiable in light of the unfairness of the tax system.
        8. Taxes are something which is taken away from me.
        9. Since everybody evades taxes, one can hardly be blamed for doing it.
        10. There is nothing bad about under-reporting taxable income on one‘s tax return
        (1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 3=neutral; 4=agree, 5=strongly agree).
In general, single-item measures in cross-cultural comparisons should be treated with
some caution. For example, in countries where tax revenues are collected to finance a
―dictator‘s war machine‖, tax evasion might be justifiable, and there could even be a
―moral duty‖ not to pay taxes. Similarly, in authoritarian political systems people will
search for ―voice‖ or ―exit‖ mechanisms via tax resistance to express their preferences
(Torgler, 2001). Moreover, there is still the potential problem in the survey studies that
some individuals may excuse their non-cooperative behavior in the past by declaring
relatively high tax morale values.
           3. Correlation between Tax Compliance/Tax Evasion and Tax Morale
A number of previous studies have investigated the simple correlation between tax
morale and the size of the shadow economy in Western societies, transition countries or
Latin America (Alm and Torgler, 2006; Alm, Martinez-Vazquez and Torgler, 2006,
Torgler, 2001, 2005a). These studies report a negative correlation with Pearson r values
between -0.51 and -0.66. Figures 1 and 2 show the correlation between tax morale in a
                                                                                          10
"
"475","country and the size of the country‘s shadow economy, using a sample of transition
countries for which estimates of the informal sector as a percent of official GDP are
available from Schneider and Klinglmair (2003). Figure 1 measures the values based on
data sets for the years 1999 and 2000. The results indicate a strong negative correlation
between both variables (-0.657), significant at the 0.01 level. In order to increase the
number of observations, in Figure 2 we include countries that are not included in the
WVS 1999-2000 but that were part of WVS 1995-1997 (19 observations in total). We
observe also in Figure 2 a strong negative correlation (Pearson r = -0.551), significant at
the 0.01 level. Thus, transition countries with low tax morale show a clear tendency to
have a large shadow economy. Indeed, a simple linear regression in both figures suggests
that a decrease of tax morale by 1 unit would lead to an increase of the shadow economy
of roughly 20 percentage points. Moreover, the variable tax morale can explain more than
30 percent of the total variance of the variable size of shadow economy.
        However, these analyses give only information about the raw and not the partial
effects. The observed correlation might be explained in terms of factors that affect the
size of the shadow economy. It is important to investigate the causes as a whole with
their interdependencies. An investigation that focuses on a simple correlation has a
somewhat limited validity. Thus, multiple regressions help us to disentangle the effects of
other factors from a possible tax morale effect. Multivariate studies indicate that tax
morale has a very strong impact on the size of the shadow economy using a cross-
sectional and a panel approach (see Torgler and Schneider, 2007a, 2009).
 III. HOW IMPORTANT ARE INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNANCE
                                       QUALITY?
                               1. Theoretical Considerations
As Cowell (1990) notes, ―… the issue of evasion is, unlike other illegal activities,
inseparably bound up with the instruments of fiscal control that the government attempts
to use in carrying out its economic policy‖.         While reducing evasion improves the
government‘s revenue, it is a broader issue for the development of a civil order (Knack
and Keefer, 1997). But, as discussed reducing tax evasion is not simply a matter of
                                                                                        11
"
"476","applying higher penalties and/or increasing the frequency of audits. Extreme penalties
may backfire by creating a setting in which bribery and corruption are more prevalent and
the end result may be lower tax compliance and a general loss of trust in the public
institutions.    Designing effective policies for reducing tax evasion requires an
understanding of the behavioral aspects of the tax compliance decision. If we find that
individual attitudes toward compliance are a function of social and cultural norms,
enhancing these norms is a desirable policy instrument to complement the usual
enforcement options.
         Taxation and public finance matters are, in democratic states, resolved through
political channels. History suggests that the need to secure an adequate degree of
consensus has been a principle driver behind the gradual (over centuries) spread of
democratic institutions. In an age of information and mobility, it is not possible for a non-
dictatorial government to stay in power without securing a certain degree of consent from
the populace in the area of taxation and government activities (Bird, Martinez-Vazquez
and Torgler, 2008). For example, Lledo, Schneider, and Moore (2003, p. 47) stress, the
key problem in Latin America is that most countries lack ―…an (implicit) social contract
between governments and the general populace of the kind that is embedded in taxation
and fiscal principles and practices in politically more stable parts of the world‖.
         State legitimacy thus rests to a considerable extent on citizens‘ ―quasi-voluntary
compliance‖ (Levi, 1988). Tyler‘s research (1990a, 1990b, 1997) provides support for the
importance of legitimacy and allegiance to authority in compliance decisions. The way
people are treated by the authorities affects their evaluations of authorities and their
willingness to co-operate. Tyler (1997) argues that understanding what people want in a
legal procedure helps to explain public dissatisfaction with the law and points towards
directions for building public support for the law in the future. To secure such
compliance, the government system must, over time, represent the basic values of at least
a minimum supporting coalition of the population. In other words, it is not only the
economic, but also the political system that affects formal and informal economic
activities. The general performance in many countries may be explained by underlying
political conditions. The political equilibrium position reflects the balance of political
forces and institutions (Bird, Martinez-Vazquez, and Torgler, 2006). Taxes are the price
                                                                                           12
"
"477","paid for government services and taxpayers generally are sensitive to the way the
government uses tax revenues. Therefore, taxpayers perceive their relationship with the
state not only as a relationship of coercion, but also as one of exchange. Individuals will
feel cheated if taxes are not spent efficiently. If citizens perceive that their interests
(preferences) are properly represented in political institutions and they receive an
adequate supply of public goods, their identification with the state increases alongside
their willingness to contribute. On the other hand, an inefficient state where corruption is
rampant will spawn citizens with little trust in authority and thus a low incentive to
cooperate. In other words, a more encompassing and legitimate state increases citizens‘
willingness to contribute. Such a state may tend to increase taxpayers‘ positive attitudes
and commitment to the tax system, with an accompanying positive effect on tax
compliance (see, e.g., Smith, 1992). Hayoz and Hug (2007, p. 10) stress: ―The state being
considered as a part of the community and not as the hostile other or ―they‖ can
reasonably expect to secure tax compliance. This is also true about governance, about
citizen participation in the management of the rules of the game. In some regions of
Eastern Europe such experiences were never made: here a ―culture of distrust‖ imply also
a ―culture of tax evasion‖. The more people are involved in establishing rules, the
stronger is their sense of obligation (Kidder and McEwen, 1989; Cialdini, 1989; McEwen
and Maiman, 1986; Lempert, 1972). There are various tax compliance studies that
indicate, e.g., that giving individuals the chance to vote on setting the rules increases
compliance (Alm, Jackson and McKee, 1993; Feld and Tyran, 2002; Torgler and
Schaltegger, 2005). Voting procedure and public discussions prior to votes, creates a
sense of civic duty, as taxpayers become aware of the importance to contribute to public
goods. Voting possibilities also provide utility in itself. Citizens value the right to
participate, because it produces a kind of procedural utility as the opportunity set
increases. It leads to an outcome (acceptance of the amnesty or not) more favourable
compared to the situation where no such voting possibility exists.
        If the government and the administration have a great discretionary power over
the allocation of resources, corruption is enhanced where the rulers are non-benevolent. A
sustainable tax system is based on a fair tax system and responsive government, achieved
with a strong connection between tax payments and the supply of public goods (Bird et
                                                                                         13
"
"478","al., 2006). Agents such as the political elite, administration staff, and legislators wield
discretionary power if institutions are neither credible nor working well. This has the
negative consequence that citizens lose their trust in the authority. In countries where
corruption is systemic and the government budget lacks transparency and accountability
the obligation of paying taxes cannot be assumed to be an accepted social norm.
Institutional instability, lack of transparency and rule of law undermine the willingness of
frustrated citizens to be active in the formal economy. Furthermore, there might be a
crowding-out effect of morality among the tax administrators when there are a great
number of corrupt colleagues. Moreover, regulatory restraints and bureaucratic
procedures not only limit competition and the operation of markets, but also provide a
better foundation for corrupt activities. If individuals and businesses believe that neither
contracts will be enforced nor productive efforts protected, their incentive to be active in
the shadow economy increases. Citizens will feel cheated if they believe that corruption
is widespread, their tax burden is not spent well, their government lacks accountability,
and that they are not protected by the rules of law.
     2. Empirical Evidence on the Impact of Institutions, Governance and Tax Reforms
Frey and Torgler (2007) explore the determinants of tax morale in Eastern and Western
Europe using the European Values Survey (EVS) 1999/2000. The study covers a large set
of countries3 using a micro data set at the individual level (covering more than 32‘000
observations). To investigate whether institutional quality matters they use six proxies of
the governance indicators developed by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2004). The
variables measure the process by which governments are selected, monitored, and
replaced (voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence), the
capacity of the government to formulate and implement sound policies (government
effectiveness, regulatory quality) and the respect of citizens and the state for the
institutions that govern economic and social interactions (rule of law and control of
corruption). All scores estimated by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2004) range
3
  Eastern European countries (Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Ukraine), Western European countries
(Austria, Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta,
Netherlands, North Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden).
                                                                                                14
"
"479","between –2.5 and 2.5 with higher scores corresponding to better institutions or outcomes.
Table A1 in the Appendix provides a summary of the 12 regression results focusing only
on the institutional coefficients. In all estimations, the coefficients of the institutional
variables have a statistically significant positive effect on tax morale. The strongest
quantitative effects are observable for voice and accountability, political stability and
regulatory quality. For example, an increase in the voice and accountability scale by one
unit increases the probability of stating that tax evasion is never justified by 7.5
percentage points. Frey and Torgler (2007) also explored the relationship between
vertical trust (trust between taxpayers and the state). Trust in the state may influence the
willingness to pay taxes but it is not necessarily related to conditional cooperation among
the citizens. Smith (1992) shows that positive actions by the state are intended to improve
taxpayers‘ attitudes and their commitment to the tax system and lead to compliant
behavior. If the state acts in a trustworthy way, taxpayers are more willing to comply
with taxes. To check for robustness, Frey and Torgler (2007) use two trust variables: trust
in the justice system and trust in the parliament. These variables allow them to analyze
trust at the constitutional level, e.g., trust in the legal system, thereby focusing on how the
relationship between the state and its citizens is established. This also allows them to
analyze trust more closely at the current politico-economic level, e.g., trust in the
parliament. In addition, they analyze the impact on tax morale of individuals‘ satisfaction
with the way democracy is developing in a country, namely satisfaction with democracy.
In general, a government that pre-commits to democratic rules imposes restraints on its
own power and thus signals its willingness to treat taxpayers as responsible persons.
Strong democratic rules indicate that citizens are not perceived to be ignorant or
uncomprehending voters, which may create or maintain social capital stock. If taxpayers
think they are in a better position to monitor and control politicians, their willingness to
pay taxes and cooperate increases. Therefore, a higher degree of satisfaction with a
country‘s democratic institution should lead to higher tax morale. The results indicate
that these factors have statistically significant positive effect on tax morale. For example,
an increase in trust in the justice system or in the parliament by one unit raises the
percentage of persons reporting the highest tax morale by more than 3 percentage points.
Similarly, a one-unit increase in satisfaction with the way democracy is developing raises
                                                                                             15
"
"480","the proportion of persons stating that tax evasion is never justified by 1.5 percentage
points. These findings demonstrate the relevance of institutions that enhance political
participation and trust in the parliament and the justice system. Such institutions have
beneficial effects on social capital and the political outcome not only in Western Europe
but also in Eastern Europe as Frey (2003a) shows.
         Torgler and Schneider (2007a, 2009) show that that improving governance and
institutional quality and tax morale helps lessen a possible incentive to go underground.
The results are quite robust using more than 25 proxies of governance and institutional
quality, testing for endogeneity and running a broad variety of specifications. Table 1
provides an overview of the results. Working with a survey done in the Czech and Slovak
Republics, Hungary, and Poland, Hanousek and Palda (2004) find strong support that
there is a positive correlation between tax evasion and the perceived government services
based on the taxes paid.
         If institutions affect tax morale and the shadow economy, it may be worthwhile to
explore also its impact on tax performance. The level of tax performance is related to the
availability of what may be called the ―exit option‖ of the so-called shadow economy. In
general, the larger the shadow economy, the lower we would expect tax effort to be.
Hence, one can measure the extent of tax effort to discover whether institutional quality
(measured by corruption and voice and accountability) affects that behavior. In other
words, it may be important to explore not only traditional variables such as tax burden,
the sectoral composition, the richness of a country or the labor market conditions - but
also institutional and governance quality. The more taxpayers believe that others work in
the shadow economy, the lower the moral costs of behaving dishonestly and evading
taxes by moving their own activities to the shadow economy. In this way the potential
intrinsic motivation to comply and contribute to public sector activities gets crowded out.
This relationship has been shown empirically by Bird et al. (2006). Public finance matters
are usually resolved through political channels, hence, as mentioned previously, history
suggests that the need to secure an adequate degree of consensus from the taxed is one of
the principal ways in which democratic institutions have spread. A better political system
is more interested in providing citizens what they want, and it transmutes individuals‘ and
firms‘ preferences into policy decisions in a more efficient manner (Bird et al., 2008).
                                                                                         16
"
"481","Moreover, Kaufmann et al. (2004) stress that ―corruption is often a manifestation of a
lack of respect of both the corrupter (typically a private citizen or firm) and the corrupted
(typically a public official or politician) for the rules that govern their interactions, and
hence represents a failure of governance according to our definition‖ (p. 255). If the
formal economy does not represent the preferences of the citizens, the resulting loss of
respect may increase participation in underground activities. Johnson, Kaufmann, and
Shleifer (1997) model the shadow economy as a substitute for the official economy, from
the assumption that individuals are mutually exclusively employed in the official
economy and the shadow economy. If more people are in the shadow economy, this
reduces the tax revenue and reduces the money available for public goods or institutional
reform, which increases the returns to participation in the shadow economy. The erosion
of the tax base by the size of the shadow economy might reduce the ability of the
government to make effective policy (Dreher et al., 2009). Katsios (2006) observes this
effect in Greece, where the inability to tax the underground economy weakens the ability
of the government to stabilize and manage the economy. This can increase social
problems which might decrease social capital and trust in the economy, which can lead to
further deterioration of institutional conditions. Dreher and Schneider (2010, p. 6) state
that ―better institutional quality… increases the benefits entrepreneurs can derive from
operating in the official sector…‖; reduces the shadow economy, and ―… should thus
reduce corruption and the size of the shadow economy alike‖. Once operations are
transferred to the shadow economy, the entrepreneur can no longer benefit from the
public goods available in the formal economy (Choi and Thum, 2005, p. 829). However,
the value of those public goods will depend on the level of corruption, as the greater the
level of corruption, the lower the tax effort, and hence the lower the resources available
for public goods.
        The issue of low tax effort in developing countries has been quite relevant in
Latin America and lessons can be learned for transition countries. Over the last forty
years, most Latin American countries found it difficult to achieve a sustainable policy
balance given the often conflicting and frequently changing forces, external and internal,
economic and political, they have faced. It is thus not surprising that their tax policies
have changed considerably over this period-- though much less in either level or structure
                                                                                           17

"482","than might have been expected. Indeed, it may be that countries tend to achieve an
equilibrium position with respect to the size and nature of their fiscal systems that largely
reflects the balance of political forces and institutions, and stay at this position until
‗shocked‘ to a new equilibrium (Bird et al., 2008). An interesting case is, e.g., Mexico
(see Bird et al. 2006). Martinez-Vazquez (2001) notes that one of the most striking
features of the various major tax changes that have taken place over the decades has been
how very little apparent effect they have had on Mexico‘s tax-GDP ratio, which has
remained almost constant. Tax policy and tax administration reforms over the last two
decades have given Mexico a tax structure that is in many ways comparable to that in
many developed countries but the tax system has continued to perform poorly in raising
adequate revenues. The management of tax policy seemed to have been a crucial element.
The good fundamental structure of Mexico‘s tax system and its revenue performance has
been undermined by numerous ad hoc policy measures. With respect to the tax on
enterprise profits, several economic sectors benefited from a special regime in which the
tax base was calculated on a cash-flow basis. Agriculture and some other sectors also
benefited from substantial lower tax rates. These and many other exceptions to the
supposedly general income and sales taxes added excess burdens, cost revenues, and
undermined the confidence of taxpayers in the fairness of the system. The summation of
these impacts is likely to have reduced voluntary compliance in the system. Tax
administration in Mexico has also faltered because tax policy measures have ignored the
ability of the tax administration to enforce complex tax issues, and in part because the tax
administration has failed to modernize (and may in some respects even have gone
backwards with respect to some of the institutional improvements achieved in earlier
periods). In sum, it appears that reforms in tax structure (1) may have been undermined
by unrelated ad hoc measures, or (2) they may have been offset by administrative
deterioration. Similar relative constancy can be seen in other countries (e.g. Colombia)
over the decades despite repeated tax reforms (McLure and Zodrow, 1997). Bird et al.
(2006) stress that a ―good tax reform‖ is comparable to a ―good‘ seat belt law‖. If
everything else stayed the same, lives can be saved (the tax ratio would increase), but
things do not stay the same leading some people to drive faster when they are belted in,
so death rates (tax ratios) may show little change.
                                                                                           18
"
"483","         Bird et al. (2006) measure tax effort as tax revenue as a share of gross domestic
product (GDP). Data for both measures of the dependent variable came from the World
Development Indicators (WDI). The model was estimated using cross-section data with
mean values for the years 1990 to 1999 for 110 transitional and developing countries.4
Table A2 in the Appendix presents a summary of the results. It can be seen that
institutions and governance play a significant role in the determination of the level of tax
effort in transition and developing countries using the Kaufmann et al. (2004) data set
and the International Country Risk Guide database. The ICRG provides an alternative set
of data to the Quality of Governance Index, with special emphasis on aspects affecting
private foreign investment decisions. The data contain annual values for indicators of the
quality of governance, constructed by Stephen Knack and the IRIS Center, University of
Maryland, and provided by The PRS Group. The results indicate the institutional factors
are always statistically significant at the 1% level with substantial quantitative effects.
Using panel data Torgler et al. (2010) extend the previous studies covering a time period
of 16 years using the ICRG risk guide data (1990-2005). They also implemented the
Kaufmann et al. (2006) data set working with the years 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and
2004. Such an analysis goes beyond the previous studies that have explored this
framework, mainly in a cross-sectional environment (e.g., Bird et al. 2006, 2008). Their
results also indicate that governance and institutional conditions have a strong impact on
tax performance.
         Looking at further factors and focusing more on tax administration using US and
data from Turkey, Torgler, Demir, Macintyre and Schaffner (2008) report that positive
attitudes towards the tax authority (e.g., how taxpayers rated tax administrations‘ job,
their honesty and fairness, and their helping and information behavior) and tax system
significantly increase tax morale. As Smith (1992) argues, ―cycles of antagonism
between the tax administration and the taxpayer might begin to break with a positive
concession by the administrator‖ (p. 226). He points out that a respectful and fair
treatment of taxpayers induces respect for the tax system and thus leads to co-operation.
On the other hand, a higher perceived tax burden crowds out the intrinsic motivation to
pay taxes. Interestingly, complexity does not have a significant effect on tax morale,

                                                                                          19

"484","while the awareness of tax issues correlates with lower tax morale. However, the
coefficient was not significant in all cases. Trust in public officials, the state and other
people has a highly significant positive effect on tax morale. Similarly, a higher
perceived level of corruption decreases the willingness to contribute. Moreover, a higher
sense of obedience and religiosity lead to a higher tax morale.
        Torgler and Murphy (2004) report a strong increase of tax morale in Australia
during the 1980s and 1990s. In early 1980s, the government faced numerous complaints
about the existing income tax system (Smith, 1993). There was prevalent perception
amongst the public that many were not meeting their taxation obligations and it was clear
that taxpayer compliance had eroded. ―Tax evasion was also contributing to public
resentment towards the existing and highly visible income tax burden‖ (Smith, 1993, p.
111). For example, during the late 1970s, the scandalous ―bottom of the harbor‖ schemes
were being widely publicized. Here, company profits were being stripped before they
could be taxed and the records conveniently lost (Levi, 1988). The more widespread the
knowledge that others were not paying their share, the more non-compliance increased.
As a consequence taxation reform was a prominent issue to taxpayers during the mid to
late 1980s, and the reforms ―substantially improved the fairness of the tax system at the
time‖ (Mathews, 1985, p. 424). In the 1986/87 financial year, the ATO (Australian
Taxation Office) introduced a self-assessment system to taxation. As discussed by
D‘Ascenzo and Poulakis (2002) the move to a self-assessment system came about
following an ATO review of the effectiveness of its traditional system of assessing
income tax returns. The ATO review concluded that the original assessment system was
not cost effective and had little effect on taxpayer compliance. Not only is the self-
assessment system of taxation a more cost effective system for the ATO, but if one
reviews the literature on regulatory theory, such a system is what regulatory scholars call
a self-regulatory system. Regulatory scholars (e.g., Ayres and Braithwaite, 1992;
Sparrow, 2000) consistently argue that if those being regulated are allowed to self-
regulate themselves in the first instance, then this serves to improve their voluntary
compliance in the long-term. This is because self-regulation is important for building and
maintaining trust among regulators and regulatees. Several empirical studies have been
able to show that trust can serve to nurture voluntary compliance (e.g., Ayres and
                                                                                          20
"
"485","Braithwaite, 1992; Braithwaite and Makkai, 1994; Torgler, 2007a). Trust appears to be a
resource like no other; it is not depleted through use but rather through lack of use
(Gambetta, 1988). Hence, the more that regulatory interactions are based on trust, the
more likely regulators such as the ATO should be able to nurture the development of
reciprocal trust relationships. Of course, for such a system to be sustainable long-term, it
also requires that a backup strategy be in place to detect and penalize those who may
attempt to cheat the system (hence, the purpose of post-assessment audits and penalties
for illegitimate returns). Moreover, the 1980s saw public administration being faced with
growing state and public demands to become more market-focused, service oriented,
open and efficient (Job and Honaker, 2003; Hughes, 1994). To respond to this, the ATO
adopted a new organizational structure designed to make them more efficient and
customer-focused. Instead of focusing so much on compliance management, risk control,
or structuring the application of enforcement discretion, the ATO slowly became more
focused on service, customers, quality, transparency and process improvement (see Job
and Honaker, 2003). In fact, the ATO was amongst the first tax administrations in the
world to implement a new client-based organizational structure (the client based model is
where staff members are assigned to units that focus on specific groups of customers; for
example, salary and wage earners, small business income taxpayers, and large business
income tax payers)5. One of the advantages of such a client-based structure is that it
allows tax administrations to better match their enforcement and educational programs to
the compliance patterns of different groups (Vehorn and Brondolo, 1999). According to
Verhorn and Brondolo (1999, p. 505), such a system has ―the potential for delivering
higher quality service to taxpayers and achieving high levels of compliance―. If taxpayers
feel that such an approach is likely to achieve better compliance levels among other
taxpayers, then this may go on to influence their own tax morale. Such a client-focused
approach is also likely to increase trust among taxpayers, as taxpayers are more likely to
feel that their needs are being considered in the regulatory process.
          Another example is Japan. The country had to be reorganized after World War II.
In 1949 the National Tax Agency (NTA) was established and a self-assessment system
5
  Prior to this, a function-based structure was used by the ATO (e.g., a separate division for processing tax
returns, another for auditing taxpayers, and another for collecting areas).
                                                                                                          21

"486","for the main taxes was introduced signaling trust in taxpayers (Okada, 2002). Usui (2002,
p. 6) reports that in 1948 around 70 percent of the taxpayers who were required to fill-out
the tax return had made filling mistakes or had not filled the returns at all. The percentage
of tax delinquency exceeded 40 percent. After continues reforms tax compliance
improved. Okada (2002) points out that at the tax agency made great efforts to provide
the public with tax information via television, radio, internet and newspapers, distributing
pamphlets and booklets and organizing every November a ―Know-Your-Tax‖ (p. 2) with
round-table discussions and essay competitions for students about taxation. It is
interesting to see how taxpayers are treated by the tax administration. If taxpayers make
obvious errors they are informed and the result of the examination is explained to them,
to make them understand the errors. Such procedures indicate that the tax administration
in Japan tries to be fair to the taxpayers. Institutions and procedures taxpayers perceive as
fair and efficient might have a positive effect on tax morale. Okada (2002) also gives a
broad survey on training programs for tax administrators. The central organization is the
National Tax College (NTC) including 12 branches nationwide, which work together
with academics, among them, many university professors, giving lectures at the college.
Such a structure shows that Japan, contrary to its Asian counterparts, invests substantial
efforts into developing a highly trained tax administration. Furthermore, the salaries of
the tax administrators according to Okada (2002) are slightly higher than for officials
engaged in other government sections, which are paid at a level comparable to the private
sector. This reduces the incentive for tax officials to demand bribes. Focusing on Asia,
Torgler (2004) observes that Japan has relatively high tax morale values within the
region.
        Feld and Frey (2002a) using a data set of tax authorities‘ behavior in Switzerland
(26 cantonal tax authorities), they find that tax authorities of cantons with more direct
participation rights treat taxpayers more respectfully and are less suspicious if taxpayers
report too low incomes than the authorities in cantons with less direct democracy. On the
other hand, non-submissions of tax declarations attract heavier fines. Feld and Frey
(2002b) continue using this framework and argue that tax morale is supported or even
raised when tax officials treat taxpayers with respect and on the other hand is reduced
when the administration considers taxpayers as individuals who have to be forced to pay
                                                                                           22

"487","the taxes: ―The feeling of being controlled in a negative way, and being suspected of tax
cheating, tends to crowd out the intrinsic motivation to act as an honorable taxpayers and,
as a consequence, tax morale will fall. In contrast, if the tax official makes an effort to
find out the reason for the error by contacting the taxpayer in an informal way, the
taxpayer will appreciate this respectful treatment and tax morale will be upheld‖ (p. 4).
They divide respectful treatment, by the tax administration into two components (p. 5):
(i) transparent and clear procedure, (ii) respecting taxpayers‘ character. Their empirical
analysis shows that treating taxpayers respectfully reduces tax evasion.
        Alm and Torgler (2006) combine a large number of Western European countries
into an empirical study using multiple regression analysis. They differentiated between
Romanic and Northern Countries. The results indicate that people from Northern Europe
possess higher tax morale than people from Southern Europe. The marginal effects
indicate that being from a Romanic country rather than from Northern Europe reduces the
probability of stating that tax evasion is never justified by 1.3 percentage points.
Similarly, Weck (1983), Weck, Pommerehne, and Frey (1984), and Frey and Weck-
Hannemann (1984) use cross-country survey results for the years 1960, 1965, 1970,
1975, and 1978 in order to develop an aggregate, country-level ―tax immorality‖ index
for various countries. Their index indicates that Romanic countries have a higher tax
immorality than most other countries. In this context, Kirchgässner (1999) argues that
state and religious authority were largely held by one person in the northern states of
Europe (in contrast to the majority of Catholic countries in the south). Offenses against
the state were therefore also religious offenses and consequently a sin. Torgler and
Schneider (2007b) looking at Switzerland, Spain and Belgium observe that cultural and
regional differences within a country also affect tax morale in both Switzerland and
Spain.
        Looking at Europe and the US, Alm and Torgler (2006) also find that the highest
tax morale is observed in the United States and in Switzerland, two countries with very
strong direct democratic traditions. Taxpayers are treated as ―citizens‖ with extensive
rights and obligations (Frey, 2003b). The possibility of taxpayers voting on fiscal issues,
and thereby being involved directly in the political decision process might enhance their
sense of civic duty (Feld and Frey, 2002a) and thus their tax morale. The instrument of
                                                                                         23
"
"488","direct democracy helps spend taxes according to citizen preferences, and the motivation
to pay taxes may increase. Such results are similar to some previous findings. Two
studies have explored Switzerland due the fact that the level of direct democracy varies
among the 26 cantons. Pommerehne and Weck-Hannemann (1996) use cross-section/time
series regressions with Swiss data and find that tax evasion is lower in cantons with a
higher degree of direct political control. Torgler (2005b) also finds with Swiss survey
data that a higher direct democracy leads to a higher tax morale. Looking at papers on
voting and tax compliance, Alm, McClelland, and Schulze (1999), Feld and Tyran (2002)
and Torgler and Schaltegger (2005) use experimental methods, and show that voting on
tax issues has a positive effect on tax compliance. Moreover, more recently the link
between local autonomy and tax morale and tax compliance has been analyzed (Torgler,
Schneider and Schaltegger, 2010). The advantage of smaller structures in tax policy is
that citizens‘ preferences are able to be better served than in a framework where a
uniform tax system is designed for a population with heterogeneous preferences.
Moreover, there is an intensive everyday interaction between taxpayers and local
politicians and bureaucrats. This closeness between taxpayers, the tax administration and
the local government may induce trust and thus enhance tax morale. Politicians and
members of the administration are better informed about the preferences of the local
population. Furthermore, there is a politico-institutional aspect: if politicians are elected
at the local level, they have an incentive to take the preferences of their constituency into
account and thus to spend the local tax revenues according to local preferences (see Frey
and Eichenberger, 1999). Decentralization brings the government closer to the people.
Many economists point out the relevance of giving sub-national governments the taxing
power (see, e.g., Bahl, 1999). One of the strengths of a decentralized system is greater
transparency between the tax price and the public services received. Taxes are
comparable to prices in some sense, especially at the local level (Blankart, 2002). Even
the (progressive) income tax is a good instrument for a local structure. It is always under
individuals‘ test, providing citizens the opportunity to use the instruments of exit and
voice (see Hirschman, 1970). The mechanism of fiscally induced migration in federal
states provides a strong incentive to provide public services in accordance to taxpayers‘
preferences. Moreover federalism and local autonomy is connected to innovation.
                                                                                           24
"
"489","Federalism serves as a laboratory for policy inventions (Oates, 1999). Looking at
Switzerland, at the cantonal level, evaluating the impact of federalism on tax morale and
the size of the shadow economy, Torgler, Schneider and Schaltegger (2010) provide
evidence that a higher level of local autonomy is correlated with higher tax morale and a
lower shadow economy.
     3. Evidence from Developing Countries: The Case of South Africa and Botswana
Further insights that might be relevant for transition countries might be derived from
comparative evidence in developing countries, under a relatively controlled environment.
Cummings, Martinez-Vazquez, McKee and Torgler (2009) have compared Botswana and
South Africa. Both countries have experienced strikingly different social histories,
despite being neighbors. Thus, these countries offer a natural experiment for the
investigation of the effects of tax morale stemming from perceptions of government.
Analyses of data from surveys of public attitudes toward government show that
perceptions of government fairness and efficacy are considerably higher in Botswana and
self-reported tax compliance appears to be higher as well. Using controlled laboratory
experiments Cummings et al. (2009) are able to confirm that these reported differences in
tax attitudes can be explained by social norms.        In the experiments, the same tax
reporting and enforcement regimes were imposed in sessions conducted in both countries.
Given the experimental control, the authors argue that observed differences in
compliance behavior are the result of differing social norms. Similarities in the tax
systems allow employment of the same jargon in each country, and since English is
widely used in both countries, the authors were able to conduct the experiments in a
common language. These facilitate comparisons of tax compliance behavior across these
otherwise widely divergent countries. Their laboratory experiments were conducted in
the fall of 1999 and the survey data were collected during 1999 – 2000.
         We have seen in the previous part of the report that tax compliance not only
depends on enforcement effort, but also on the inhibitors that are inherent in the
individual-government relationships. For the personal income tax (PIT), the self-
assessment and audit processes are similar in both countries although there are varying
degrees of aggressiveness in enforcement. Both countries rely on some form of
                                                                                       25
"
"490","withholding during the year and individual self-assessment and reporting of final tax
liabilities. Tax evasion is treated as a serious crime in South Africa; the tax authority
exploits high profile cases to reinforce its reputation for tough enforcement.6 The South
Africa Revenue Service (SARS) has a policy of not revealing the audit rules or penalties.
In Botswana, on the other hand, the attitude of the tax authority seems to be more
accommodating. For example, a general tax amnesty was conducted in 1999. This was
yet to occur in South Africa during conduct of the present study.
         The respective computations of the tax bases are quite similar in South Africa and
Botswana. In South Africa, the PIT base consists of wages and salaries as well as passive
income (e.g., interest and dividends) but not capital gains. In Botswana, the PIT base
includes wages and salaries as well as all investment income (interest, dividends, and
capital gains). In Botswana the marginal rate is capped at 25 percent, which is lower than
the rates in South Africa (45 percent) and other neighboring countries. Various
exemptions and deductions (but no dependent deductions) are offered in Botswana.
Thus, there are substantial differences across the countries in terms of maximum
marginal rates. In Botswana, the investigative division carries out in-depth case
examination where tax evasion is suspected. Civil penalties can be imposed for failure to
file if taxes are owed. These penalties consist of interest at the rate of two percent per
month and a penalty not to exceed the tax owed. Criminal penalties not to exceed one
year can be imposed for egregious evasion and or fraud. In South Africa the penalty
structure is generally harsher. Any person required to file a return who fails to do so
within the period mentioned above, is liable to a penalty not exceeding R2,000 and/or to
imprisonment for a period not exceeding twelve months. Further, his/her taxable income
may be estimated and three times the amount of tax charged thereon. Any taxpayer who
knowingly and willfully makes any false statement in his/her return or evades or attempts
to evade taxation and any person who assists a taxpayer to do so, is liable to a penalty not
exceeding R1,000 and/or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years. The
taxpayer is, in addition, liable to be assessed and charged three times the amount of the
tax, which he/she sought to evade.

  About the time of our experiments, a South African newspaper article reported that Bishop Desmond
Tutu‘s son Trevor was sentenced to 12 months in jail for tax evasion (The Star, October 28, 1999 p 6,
Johannesburg, SA).
                                                                                                  26
"
"491","        The level of sophistication of the tax enforcement apparatus differs considerably
between Botswana and South Africa. SARS implemented a modern computerized tax
collections and administration monitoring system in 1997, which was hoped to improve
data integrity, reduce human intervention, and increase effectiveness and productivity.
Botswana‘s tax administration system is evolving but enjoys less resources.             Both
countries take steps to associate taxation with the provision of government services. For
example, the tax legislation of South Africa explicitly states, ―taxes are not a punishment,
they are the price paid for government services‖.
        A comparison of tax morale in Botswana and South Africa is certainly natural.
Although geographic neighbors, the social histories of the two countries could not differ
more. Botswana‘s political history is virtually unique among African countries.
Although it was a colony (British) and only recently (1966) gained independence,
diamond-rich Botswana is one of Africa's oldest multiparty democracies and has
successfully transitioned to self-governance. Several elections have been held since
independence and all have been quiet affairs with none of the violence or corruption
charges that have accompanied elections in neighboring countries.               In fact, the
government of Botswana takes great pride in its stability and refers to itself as the ―gem
of Africa‖ in many official publications. A message is clear: the government is working
for you – paying taxes constitutes part of this social contract. Acemoglu, Johnson and
Robinson (2002) report that pre-colonial tribal institutions developed by the Tswana
tribes, encouraged cooperation and participation and helped to constrain political elites.
The Botswana experience is in marked contrast with South Africa with its well-known
history of apartheid and social discord. Indeed elections in South Africa held prior to our
period of analysis have been controversial and often accompanied by violence. Both the
white and black populations have reason to be suspicious of the government. The white
population has been concerned about protection of property rights (especially in the face
of proposals for land reform) while the black population has little reason to trust any
government until it has been demonstrated that such trust is warranted. The political
history of South Africa has been conflictive with the government struggling to establish
trust. Crime rates are very high (one of the highest in the world, in fact) and there is a
                                                                                          27

"492","feeling that the social order is somewhat fragile, although, the government has recently
undertaken steps to address these sentiments.
         Table      A3     provides      detailed      institutional     comparisons.       Transparency
International‘s Corruption Perception Index, which relates corruption perceptions of
various countries‘ government, indicates considerable differences between Botswana and
South Africa: Botswana‘s score is some 20 percent higher (better) than South Africa‘s.
These results are consistent with the Quality of Governance Index provided by Kaufmann
et al. (2004). Botswana has higher control of corruption values than South Africa.
Similarly, the Rule of Law Index, which measures the degree of agents‘ confidence in
and compliance with social rules, is more than three times larger in Botswana.
Consequently, the respect of citizens for the state and the institutions that govern
economic and social interactions is higher in Botswana. The capacity of the government
to effectively formulate and implement sound policies (represented as the government
effectiveness and regulatory quality) is higher in Botswana, which also has a higher level
of political stability and absence of violence. Only voice and accountability are higher in
South Africa, referring to the process by which governments are selected, monitored and
replaced. Overall, the values of these six governance dimensions for the periods 1998
and 2000 clearly indicate a higher level of institutional quality in Botswana compared to
South Africa. These results are also supported by the International Country Risk Guide
(ICRG). Table A3 also shows that political rights and the level of civil liberty are similar
in both countries. To measure the variable income inequality – we use the newest
available data set, Estimated Household Income Inequality (EHII), constructed by
Galbraith and Kum (2005)7. The GINI coefficients indicate that income inequality is
slightly greater in Botswana. The Index of Economic Freedom clearly indicates a higher
fiscal burden8 for South Africa, but also less government interventions in South Africa.
The Polity IV data set shows, in line with previous data sets, that Botswana has more

  The index of fiscal burden measures the burden a government imposes on its citizens. The following
variables have been integrated in the index: top income tax rate, tax rate an average taxpayer faces, top
corporate tax rate and government expenditures measured as a percentage of GDP. To get the index, the
scores of the income tax rate and the corporate tax rate are measured separately and then averaged to get a
single taxation score. The final score for the fiscal burden consists of the averaged scores for income and
corporate taxation and for government expenditures.

"493","stable political institutions than South Africa. Some studies have shown tendencies exists
for ethnic fractionalization to negatively influence economic success and the quality of
institutions (see, e.g., Easterly and Levine, 1997; La Porta et al., 1999; Alesina et al.,
2003). Easterly and Levine (1997) found that for Africa, greater ethnic diversity goes in
line with low schooling, underdeveloped financial systems, distorted foreign exchange
markets, and insufficient infrastructure.
         In general, these results were confirmed using a survey data set from the
Afrobarometer, a relatively new survey measuring the social, political and economic
atmosphere in more than ten countries in Africa. Examining these results, we observe that
individuals in Botswana are more compliant than those in South Africa. The marginal
effects indicate that being a resident of Botswana rather than of South Africa increases
the probability of reporting the highest tax honesty by around 6 percentage points. This
result is robust across various specifications. Figure A1 in the Appendix reports the
results of the experiment. It shows a clear difference in behavior between subjects from
Botswana and South Africa throughout most of the different experimental treatments.
Moreover, the results obtained also indicate that tax culture effect overwhelms the
enforcement effort. Thus, increasing audit probability and/or the penalty for South
African subjects leads to lower compliance.
IV. HOW STABLE IS TAX MORALE AND HOW IMPORTANT ARE
                              SOCIAL INTERACTIONS?
We have seen in the previous section that values and preferences are affected by policy or
institutional changes. Thus, these results support Bowles‘ (1998) argument that ―we can
neither accurately predict nor coherently evaluate the likely consequences of new policies
or institutions without taking account of preference endogeneity‖ (p. 75). This can be
seen as an indicator that tax morale does not remain stable over time. Changes in the
political system have a substantial impact on tax morale. In the fields of behavioral law
and economics, the importance of social norms in studying compliance with the law has
been emphasized for several years (Ellickson, 1991; Tyler, 1990b; Sunstein, 1996;
Cooter, 1998). Accordingly, social norms are shaped by law and by social interactions. In
                                                                                       29
"
"494","addition to the direct deterrence effects of legal sanctions, Posner (1998, 2000a, b) argues
that deterrence signals social norms to citizens in order to educate them what they should
do. Smith and Mackie (2000, p. 377) note: ―Norms must be brought to mind before they
can guide behavior. They can be activated by deliberate reminders or by subtle cues, such
as observations of other people‘s behavior‖. Kahan (1997) suggests that the decision to
commit crimes is highly interdependent, based on the perceived behavior of others:
―When they perceive that many of their peers are committing crimes, individuals infer
that the odds of escaping punishment are high and the stigma of criminality is low. To the
extent that many persons simultaneously draw these inferences and act on them,
moreover, their perceptions become a self-fulfilling reality.‖ (p. 394). As a consequence,
individuals‘ beliefs about crime are altered, suggesting that social influence affects
criminality and the propensity to commit crimes. Furthermore, Kahan (1997) suggests
that the law is able to shape these perceptions by the way in which it creates information
about the compliance/deviance of citizens. These findings suggest that there is an effect
of social learning on tax compliance. The relevance of social interaction and crime is
explored by Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman (1996) who focus on the United States
in their analysis both across cities and across precincts in New York. The results indicate
that social interaction models provide a framework for understanding variances of cross-
city crime rates. Individuals are more likely to commit crimes when those around them
do. Fortin, Lacroix and Villeval (2007) analyze the impact of social interaction on
individual tax decisions in an experimental setting.
        In this section of the report this aspect is explored further. The focus will be on a
comparison of East and West Germany directly after unification as a quasi-natural
experiment. Results might provide valuable insights how tax morale changes when
societies and nations are integrated in new institutional environments. Such insights may
provide valuable guidance whether we may observe a tax morale adaption process in the
Eastern enlargement process of the European Union. Moreover, this section will also
explore the importance of social interactions focusing on Eastern and Western Europe.
        Feld, Torgler and Dong (2008) analyse the differences in tax morale between East
and West Germany and the convergence of morale across time between 1990 and 1999
German unification provides valuable insights for the analysis of tax morale because
                                                                                           30
"
"495","many factors can be controlled for which are similar in both parts of the country, e.g., a
common language, similar education systems and a shared cultural and political history
after the Second World War and prior to the separation. As a consequence, an East-West
comparison has a methodological advantage as compared to cross-country studies. Thus,
it is possible to observe how taxpayers adapt to a new legal environment that provides
signals to them how they should behave and how others behave regarding taxation. As
the Iron Curtain fell, former GDR citizens became exposed to the West German system
including the social welfare state, the tax system and the whole set of formal and informal
rules. The question remains how fast individuals may change their social norms. In the
focus countries, people gradually internalized norms and values they were forced to
respect for years before the reunification. Feld et al. (2008) were interested in exploring
these social learning effects on tax morale over time. The unification process provides for
a unique opportunity to study this research question. East German citizens faced different
legal systems before and after unification. While deterrence was generally high in the old
GDR, black markets and the shadow economy were ubiquitous. Thus, each GDR citizen
could observe that their fellow citizens engaged in the shadow economy. After
unification, East German taxpayers were confronted with new laws and new deterrence
levels which have only been slowly increased across time. East Germans could also
realize the tax morale of the West German taxpayers and adjust their behavior
accordingly. So far, the literature on tax compliance has failed to explore social learning,
herding behavior or convergence processes in general. This paper addresses this
shortcoming by exploring the unification process in Germany using three World Values
Survey/European Values Survey waves between 1990 and 1999. German unification is
interesting for the analysis of tax morale over time and the exploration of a social
learning process. As mentioned, many factors can be controlled (e.g., a common
language, similar education systems and a shared cultural and political history prior to the
separation after the Second World War). Feld et al.‘s (2008) findings indicate that tax
morale converged after unification in Germany. While tax morale was significantly
different in East compared to West Germany in 1990, both regions do not differ
significantly in their tax morale levels in 1999. This result holds whether descriptive
analysis, non-parametric tests or a differentiated multivariate analysis is conducted.
                                                                                          31
"
"496","Within just nine years after unification, tax morale values strongly converged, due in
particular to a significant change in the level of tax morale in the East. Interestingly, older
individuals in the East who were exposed for a longer time to the old regime, were less
likely to change their social norms. As Kasper and Streit (1999) argue, the East Germans
had to unlearn the old institutions and learn new ones, which requires some time and
practice.
        Looking at social interactions, one can argue that the behavior of other taxpayers
is of great importance in understanding taxpayers‘ compliance. Individuals pay their
taxes conditionally, depending on the pro-social behavior of other taxpayers. They are
more willing to pay their taxes if they perceive others to be honest. The extent to which
others also contribute, triggers more or less cooperation and systematically influences the
willingness to contribute. Relying on surveys from 30 European countries (EVS
1999/2000), Frey and Torgler (2007) show that if taxpayers believe tax evasion to be
common, their tax morale decreases. In contrast, if they believe others to be honest, their
tax morale increases. This result is consistent with the literature on conditional
cooperation (see, e.g., Rabin, 1998; Falk and Fehr, 2002; Tyran and Feld, 2006). Lewis
(1982, p. 144) argues for the possible existence of a ―tax subculture, with its own set of
unwritten rules and regulations. Thus I am more likely to evade not only because I have
friends who, I know, have got away with it (so why shouldn‘t I?) but also because
evasion is ethically acceptable among my friends … Furthermore, ‗no friends of mine can
be criminals‘ …‗What‘s good enough for fine, upstanding citizens like Fred Bloggs, John
Doe, Donald Campbell, Herman Schmitt and Hans Anderson is good enough for me‘‖.
        Frey and Torgler (2007) use a non-linear ordered probit model (due to ranking
information of the scaled dependent variable), and control for a large set of factors. They
employ the following question to investigate the impact of conditional cooperation:
“According to you, how many of your compatriots do the following: Cheat on taxes if
they get the chance?” (4=almost all, 1=almost none). Consistent with the social
interaction and conditional cooperation literature, the estimation results indicate that the
higher is the perceived tax evasion of other individuals, the lower is the respondent‘s tax
morale. The size of the effect is substantial; if perceived tax evasion rises by one unit, the
percentage of persons reporting high tax morale falls by 7.4 percentage points. Table A4
                                                                                             32
"
"497","indicates the importance of conditional cooperation focusing on all single countries
individually summarizing the results of 30 regressions reporting only the coefficient for
conditional cooperation. In 27 of the 30 countries, the coefficients are highly statistically
significant and have a negative sign. This is strong evidence of conditional cooperation in
most Eastern and Western European countries. The more individuals expect others
members of society to cooperate, the higher the individual‘s intrinsic motivation to pay
taxes.
              V. EVIDENCE FROM A EUROPEAN COUNTRY:
                            A CASE STUDY ON SPAIN
To better understand potential developments of tax morale in transition countries, one
may focus on a European country that has a history of being part of the European Union
and that has experienced substantial changes over time. It is therefore valuable to focus
on Spain; the country has undergone fundamental changes in the public sector since its
transition to a democratic system after the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975.
The previous two sections of this report would suggest that such changes should affect
tax morale in Spain. These very significant changes in Spanish society during the last 30
years offer an opportunity to examine citizens‘ attitudes toward paying taxes and the
ways in which these attitudes are affected by changes in government policies and
institutions. Martinez-Vazquez and Torgler (2009) use survey data from the World
Values Survey (WVS) and the European Values Survey (EVS) to observe the evolution
of tax morale in Spain at four benchmark years: 1981, 1990, 1995, and 1999/2000.
Although these years do not coincide with any particular key event in the recent history
of Spain, they cover a period long enough to incorporate many of the important reforms
of the Spanish public sector. The study of the evolution of tax morale in modern Spain is
particularly interesting because of the constitutional and political changes after Franco
died in 1975. The advent of a fully democratic state, deep tax policy and tax
administration reforms, a significant push for decentralization, joining the European
Community and so on provide excellent benchmarks for institutional changes that are
expected in the compliance literature to change tax morale. The issue of tax morale in
Spain so far has attracted little attention in the literature (for exceptions, see Prieto
                                                                                          33
"
"498","Rodriguez, Sanzo-Pérez and Suárez Pandiello, 2005; Molero and Pujol, 2005; Alm and
Torgler, 2006; Alm and Gomez, 2009) and as a novelty Martinez-Vazquez and Torgler
(2009) focus on the inter-temporal evolution of tax morale in a country using data from
different WVS survey waves.
     The last 30 years represent a period of radical transformation for Spain, which could
have profoundly affected the way citizens view the state and ultimately, their tax morale.
The state of tax morale was quite low at the end of Franco‘s regime. As reported by
Comin (2007), at the end of the 1970s, tax evasion in Spain was estimated at 40 percent
of tax receipts and above 90 percent of all Spanish taxpayers recognized the existence of
fiscal fraud. In addition, at the time the fiscal system provided ample tax evasion
opportunities for the wealthy, and there was no political will to prosecute fiscal fraud. In
particular, tax evasion was not a criminal offense and evaders only received small
administrative sanctions. After Franco‘s death, the first democratic elections took place in
1977 and were won by a center-right coalition (the UCD — Unión de Centro
Democrático). The highlight of this period was the coalescence of all political forces in
the country in what became known as the Moncloa Pacts of 1977. These Pacts set the
foundations for political reform, with a new Constitution being approved in 1978. These
Pacts also set the blueprints for deep fiscal reform, including legislation making tax
evasion a crime.      The goals of the Moncloa Pacts were to introduce policy and
institutional reforms in the public and private sectors, that would bring Spain up to par
with the system Spain‘s European neighbors had put in place almost three decades earlier
following the end of World War II (see Comin, 2007). The period subsequent to the
Moncloa Pacts was one of political indecision, poor economic performance and political
turmoil - including a failed coup by a small group of security forces in 1981. It appeared
that the government had withdrawn from its commitments made in the Moncloa Pacts in
terms of policy reforms, including the modernization of the tax administration and the
fight against tax evasion.
     Fiscal and other institutional reforms gained momentum with the new Socialist
Party: the Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE) government after their election
victory in 1982. The PSOE would stay in power until the general elections of 1996.
Several important changes and reforms took place during this period. Perhaps the most
                                                                                         34
"
"499","significant event was joining the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1986. The
accession to the EEC meant, among other things, the introduction for the first time in
Spain of the Valued Added Tax (VAT), required by the harmonization of Spain‘s tax
system with EEC rules.
     But even before the accession to the EEC the government embarked on a series of
fiscal reforms. The first Socialist government tax reforms that took place between 1983
and 1987 developed the vision of the Moncloa Pacts. Besides the introduction of the
VAT, the Personal Income Tax was overhauled with an emphasis on vertical equity and
progressivity. Also important for the evolution of tax morale in this period, a major effort
got under way to modernize the tax administration apparatus. These reforms in tax
administration included the territorial reorganization of the tax agency, the
computerization of services, upgraded professional careers for tax officials, and setting
up other instruments for increasing voluntary taxpayer compliance and fighting tax
evasion. Following the Supreme Court ruling declaring the use of the ―family‖ as the
unit of taxation unconstitutional, the 1998 tax reform sought to slow down the pace of
government growth, lower tax rates and broaden tax bases to increase economic
efficiency and horizontal fairness. This was alongside a general aim to bring the Spanish
tax system in line with the, then existing reform trends, in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.
     As noted by Comin (2007), the 1998 reform package represented an end to the
Spanish welfare state even before the task had been completed. In a way, Spain was still
trying to catch up with its European peers when the rules of the game had shifted. Thus,
the fiscal reforms of the first twenty years of democracy, were now also in need of
reform. Although many of these necessary reforms were introduced by the Socialist
government, some were delayed until the change in government. After the right-center
Partido Popular (PP) took office in 1996, fiscal reform continued to move in the direction
of increasing the relative importance of indirect over direct taxes and reducing the budget
deficit and debt levels in order to join the European Monetary Union. Economic realities
had already forced many of Spain‘s European neighbors to follow suit with tax changes
in the United States and elsewhere in the world lowering rates, broadening tax bases,
putting more emphasis on consumption taxes, and containing the costs associated with
                                                                                         35
"
"500","social insurance contributions. Potentially more important for tax morale, these reforms
worldwide were now accepting the limitations of significant income redistribution
through progressive income taxes. The tax reforms initiated by the PP embraced all these
principles. For example, tax rates on capital gains were reduced in 1996 and in 1998, and
a new, more favorable, tax regime for small and medium sized companies was enacted.
The PP reforms of the Personal Income Tax in the first years of the new millennium were
further oriented toward reducing the tax burden, especially at the low end of the income
distribution; more visible were the reductions of marginal tax rates across the board,
including the top rate. The PP government at the time also pursued strict budget
discipline, generating low deficits or surpluses and reducing the outstanding public debt,
in order to meet the EU‘s requirements in the Stability and Growth Pact.
     Aside from these reforms, there were many other events that potentially shaped
ordinary citizens‘ views of the state. These included the already mentioned coup attempt
in 1981; a sizable bout of corruption by public officials during the last Socialist
government in the mid-1990s; and a profound fiscal, administrative and political
decentralization enabled by the 1978 Constitution. The state also had to contend with
centrifugal separatist forces, especially in the Basque Country with the terrorist activity
by Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA). On the side of general performance of the economy,
the country witnessed massive and much needed privatization of state-owned enterprises
and a rise in unemployment due to a rigid system of labor institutions. Nevertheless the
Spanish economy continued to experience high rates of economic growth for most of the
transition period.
     Martinez-Vazquez and Torgler‘s (2009) estimation results support the conjecture that
during this time, Spain succeeded in designing general institutional reforms, including tax
policy and tax administration reforms that led to significant increases in tax morale, even
though some deterioration of tax morale was present between the 1995 and 1999/2000
observations. A key empirical result in this paper is the significant changes in tax morale
in Spain over time, as reflected by the time effects estimated across the four time periods
when the surveys were conducted. The time effects remain statistically significant in
different specifications of the estimating equation. Tax morale increased steadily from
1981 to 1995 and then declined slightly, but nevertheless significantly through
                                                                                         36
"
"501","1999/2000. The tax and other institutional reforms that got started with the Moncloa
Pacts and continued through the accession to the European Economic Community quite
likely helped boost Spanish citizens‘ tax morale. The small but significant decline in tax
morale during the second half of the 1990s still remains somewhat of a puzzle. However
likely causes identified include institutional changes such as corruption in the public
sector, a perception of lower levels of tax fairness, or even high levels of unemployment
in the economy.
     In sum, the dramatic increase in tax effort in a relatively short period of time in Spain
accompanied by improved taxpayer morale, can provide useful lessons to transition
countries in how to execute fiscal reform. Exemplified methods include increasing tax
revenues to finance basic public services and infrastructure underpinning sustainable
economic growth.
             VI. EVIDENCE FROM A TRANSITION COUNTRY:
                           A CASE STUDY ON RUSSIA
In many Eastern European countries fundamental changes in the role and effectiveness of
the public sector have occurred during the transition years in the 1990s. It may therefore,
be interesting to explore a key and important player in Eastern Europe, namely Russia. In
November 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and the Russian Federation was born
after Russia and other former Soviet republics refused to remit tax revenues to the Soviet
government (Martinez-Vazquez and Boex, 2001). Many difficult policy choices had to
be made in this new era including the role of the public sector in general and the structure
of the tax system in particular. Indeed, two of the biggest challenges were to reinvent the
state, which had endured (during Soviet times mostly) a record of ineffectiveness and
corruption, and to convince citizens who had not paid taxes directly under the Soviet
regime, to start complying voluntarily with their new tax obligations.
        The dynamic changes in Russia during the transition decade of the 1990s offer an
excellent opportunity to examine citizens‘ attitudes toward paying taxes. In particular,
they are helpful in analyzing the ways in which these attitudes are affected by (or
                                                                                            37
"
"502","reflected in) changes in government policies and institutions. Alm, Martinez-Vazquez
and Torgler (2006) use therefore micro-level data for Russia from the World Values
Survey and the European Values Survey for the years 1991, 1995, and 1999 to examine
how these attitudes have changed during the tumultuous events of the 1990s.
         The 1990s were a transforming decade for Russia. This period begins with the
dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in December 1991. It spans the
presidency of Boris Yeltsin, who was elected President by popular vote in June 1991 and
who served until December 1999, when he resigned and Vladimir Putin became acting
President. Putin was elected president shortly after with considerable popular support and
authority to carry out a backlog of reforms. The 1990s were also a period during which
major legislation was enacted9. Abstracting these legal changes, many other events also
shaped the perceptions of ordinary citizens toward the new state. Notable socio-political
events include: the August 1991 coup attempt; the political struggle and final victory of
Yeltsin over the communist-dominated parliament; the centrifugal separatist forces in
ethnic regions from Chechnya to Tatarstan to Bashkiria; the massive privatization of state
assets and the rise of the Russian oligarchs; the questionable alliance of the oligarchs with
the Kremlin for Yeltsin‘s reelection; the financial crisis and debt default of August 1998;
the beginning of the economic recovery and the consolidation of power in Putin‘s hands
the next year. The Russian Federation is characterized by strong ethnic, economic, and
fiscal disparities between the regions, including some sorts of secessionist forces
(Polishchuck, 1996). In general, the relationship between the Krelim and the regions
during the 1990s went from laissez faire in the early Yeltsin years, to open conflict and
full defiance in the middle of decade when many of the regions maintained secret
bilateral treaties with Moscow, to recentralization and the imposition of more uniform
discipline toward the end of the decade, especially after Putin took power. However, the
relationship between Moscow and the 89 regions varied considerably across regions.
Since then, richer, better-off regions have pushed for higher retention rates of tax
9
  This legislation transformed the Russian Federation: the Law on Basic Principles of the Tax System in the
Russian Federation (December 1991); the new Constitution of 1994; the Law on the General Principles of
Organization of Local Self-government in the Russian Federation (August 1995); the introduction in 1997
and 1998 of important reforms based on the draft Tax Code, the Budget Code, the Law on Financial
Foundations of Local Self-governments, and the Concept of Reform of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
in the Russian Federation.
                                                                                                        38

"503","revenues collected within their borders, while poorer, transfer-dependent regions have
been supportive of more centralized finances. Many of the heavily ethnic regions have
supported more autonomy from Moscow, while those regions with heavy Russian
populations identified more with the Russian state. The dominant political color of the
regions has also played a role; those regions with a high level of communist party support
have been traditionally more antagonist toward Moscow (Martinez-Vazquez, 2002).
Because of these differences, Alm et al. (2006) stress that attitudes toward paying taxes
may differ across these regions during the transition years. Subsequently, their data sets
for 1995 and 1999 allow us to analyze the different levels of tax morale in 11 different
territories of the Russian Federation. Their results indicate a decay in tax morale in the
first four years of the transition from 1991 to 1995, and a small recovery in 1999 (see
Figure A2 in the Appendix). Interestingly, Hanousek and Palda (2008) observe a similar
pattern exploring tax evasion using survey data from 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006 from
the Czech Republic to measure its development for the years 1995 to 2006. Their results
indicate that the number and percentage of evaders increased until the early millennium
and started to decrease calling such an inverse-U shape ―an evasional Kuznets curve‖ (p.
3) stressing also that this might be an indication that hysteresis ―may not be a feature of
evasion in a transition economy‖ (p. 3).
         These results from Russia are consistent with the relevance of social norms in tax
compliance.      The widespread perception of tax evasion along with the economic
convulsions revealed inadequate social institutions, and led to an initial crowding out of
the intrinsic motivation to pay taxes from 1991 to 1995. These results also suggest
restoration of higher trust levels in the state in 1999, after progress in the transition to a
market economy had been made - a transition that positively influenced individual
attitudes toward paying taxes. The analysis of disaggregated data for Russian regions
also shows significant regional differences in tax morale, reflecting self-interest and the
degree of trust different regions have toward Moscow‘s institutions and policies. Looking
at the distribution of tax morale scores in each of the three different years, the results
indicate large differences between the percentage of individuals with a high tax morale (a
score of 3) and those with the lowest scores across these years (see Figure A3). The
deterioration in tax morale in Russia from 1991 to 1995 was strongly affected by a
                                                                                            39
"
"504","reduction in the share of those citizens who believe that tax evasion is never justifiable
(the score of 3), and an increase in the share of individuals who believe that tax evasion is
justifiable (the score of 0). The tax morale improvement between the 1995 and 1999 is
based mainly on the reduction of the share represented by those who believe that tax
evasion is justifiable (the score of 0) and also on steady but small increases in the share of
individuals in the other three categories. The results indicate that there is a significant
difference between 1991 and 1995 and also between 1991 and 1999, with higher z-values
for the year 1991. However, the differences between 1995 and 1999 are not statistically
significant at conventional levels (see Table A5). These results indicate that, once tax
morale was crowded out in the early years of the transition, it recovered only slowly
toward the end of the period. The data for 1999 may be too close to the financial crisis of
1998 and other recent negative experiences for a marked improvement in tax morale to
take hold. Nevertheless, these broad swings in tax morale in the aggregate data parallel
quite well what was happening to and around Russian citizens at those different periods
during the transition. Although government was still providing many basic services just
before the beginning of the transition process in 1991, the overall performance of the
public sector was poor and corruption levels were high. From the very start of the
transition at the end of 1991 and through the early months of 1992, the socio-economic
conditions confronting Russian citizens suddenly deteriorated, on a massive scale, as the
level and quality of public services declined even further.           The rapid collapse of
institutional structures produced a vacuum in the country, followed by worsening income
inequality and poverty rates. Quite likely, taxpayers reacted adversely to the economic
and tax policy changes that were necessary for the transition from a centrally controlled
to a market economy.
         Overall, then, in the first years of the transition, Russia did not succeed in
designing tax systems, tax administrations, or other government structures and
institutions (especially improved public service delivery) that would have helped to
maintain tax morale. Further, as Kasper and Streit (1999) stress, law and order were
strongly violated in the former Soviet Union and later in Russia. The lack of a ―rule of

improvement of tax morale, at least in the first phases of the transition. Corruption also

"505","increased in the early years, reducing citizens‘ trust in government authority (Levin and
Satarov, 2000) whilst corruption was likely heightened by a privatization process that
lacked effective legal regulation and impartial oversight.10 It has also been criticized that
in resource-based states such as Russia the state elite has the incentive and ability to
generated revenues and increase the control over resources relying therefore less on taxes
which leads to an under-development of tax performance and a reduced level of political
accountability (Hayoz and Hug, 2007). The evolution of tax reform also likely played a
role on the behavior of tax morale.                   Despite the declared federal objectives for
decentralization of the public finances, the system remained highly centralized as
regional shares and local revenues or expenditures were dictated by a higher level of
government (Lavrov, Litwack, and Sutherland, 2000). As Levin and Satorov (2000)
point out, the suspicious processes imbedded in the centralized structure of the tax
system, where the taxes collected regionally were directed first to the central government,
before returning to the regions in the form of transfers, contributed little to local citizens‘
beliefs that their preferences counted at all.11 Even so, there was a trend toward an
improvement in tax morale from 1995 to 1999. There are several factors that may
explain this improvement. The increase may have been influenced by the start of reform
discussions related to the draft Tax Code and the Budget Code and also by some new
initiatives such as the Law on Financial Foundations of Local Self-government and the
Concept of Reform of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations in the Russian Federation, both
of which had the goal of increasing revenue autonomy at the subnational level.
         In addition, changes in tax morale over time are also likely to be related to the
performance of the economy. If taxpayers can relate poor economic performance to poor
government policy decisions, then this will affect negatively voluntary compliance with
the taxes. Conversely, taxpayers may credit improved economic performance to
improved government performance, and thereby increase their willingness to pay taxes.
In this respect, several authors have contrasted the relative economic performances of
10
   Levin and Satarov (2000) calculate that the level of corruption in the early years of the Russian transition
exceeded the total expenditures on science, education, health care, culture, and art and that, in some
industrial branches, criminal groups spent up to 50 percent of their revenues to bribe officials. They also
report that in 1995 there were 270 cases of illegal tax inspector activities that were exposed.
11
   Several authors (Bahl and Wallich, 1995; Martinez-Vazquez and Boex, 2001) criticized the lack of
transparency in the fiscal system and the failure to provide sub-national governments with adequate
resources to meet their responsibilities.
                                                                                                             41

"506","Russia and China during the 1990s. Stiglitz (1999) emphasizes that, over the decade
beginning in 1989, China‘s gross domestic product (GDP) doubled while Russia‘s GDP
almost halved. Different explanations have been offered for these two performances.
For example, Blanchard and Shleifer (2001) explain China‘s better performance on the
basis of the existence of strong central control of the economy by the Communist Party,
which kept centrifugal forces under check; in contrast, they claim that a weak federal
government in Russia was unable to control destructive behaviors of the regions.
Similarly, Fisher and Sahay (2000) argue that Russia lagged in the implementation of
structural reforms and failed to solve its fiscal problems, which led to large fiscal deficits
and ultimately to the financial collapse in August of 1998. Shleifer and Treisman (1999)
blame Russia‘s poorer performance on the common pool incentive problem created in
Russia by the revenue sharing of all main taxes between the federal government and the
regions. In contrast, Montinola, Qian, and Weingast (1995) and Qian and Weingast
(1996) argue that China‘s revenue assignments were ―market preserving‖ (unlike
Russia‘s) in that the Chinese assignments stimulated local governments to become
entrepreneurial and to seek the growth of their local economies. Whatever the
explanation for the poorer economic performance of Russia, the fact is that large
proportions of the Russian population suffered income declines throughout much of the
1990s. For example, Graham and Pettinato (2002) use data from the Russia Longitudinal
Monitoring Survey, and find that 77 percent of the population sampled had income
declines from 1995 to 1998. Interestingly, at the time of the third Longitudinal Survey in
1999 the Russian economy experienced positive rates of growth. Alm, Martinez-
Vazquez, and Torgler (2006) observe significant regional differences in individuals‘
attitudes toward paying taxes. There are strong ethnic, economic, and fiscal disparities
across the Russian regions.       Each region generally shows a diverse picture, with
significant changes between 1995 and 1999 in tax morale.             The newest data they
analyzed suggest a tendency for wealthier regions to have a higher tax morale than poorer
ones. Furthermore, the data suggests a tendency toward lower tax morale prevails in
regions possessing strong separatist sentiments, a prevalent belief that the region has been
exploited by the central government, and a general political dislike for Moscow. The
                                                                                           42

"507","results also indicate that vertical trust (trust in the government and the legal system) is a
key driving force to understand what shapes tax morale in Russia.
        There are several possible reasons for this evolution in attitudes. The transition
imposed a higher and more visible tax burden at a time that a crumbling economy meant
that many public services had to decline in quality and coverage. Meanwhile, a nescient
tax administration adopted highly repressive and antagonistic policies toward taxpayers,
even those who wanted to comply with the tax laws. During the 1990s, the Russian tax
enforcement strategy was strongly based on coercion methods, mainly increasing the
mandate of law enforcement agents. The tax police gained increased power, and grew
into a bureaucracy with around 50,000 employees, or one third of the size of the tax
administration. As a consequence, the number of criminal investigations by the tax
police increased from 2,500 in 1994 to 16,000 in 1999, a number that represents four
times more investigations than in the United States in 1999 (Easter, 2007). It took time
for the federal tax authorities to realize that a strategy that emphasizes enforcement and
punishment alone cannot be the only solution to improving voluntary tax compliance.
Indeed, it is likely that such a strategy had a counter-productive effect. If the majority of
taxpayers are not treated as responsible persons with an intrinsic motivation to pay taxes,
they may soon feel that they may as well be opportunistic.             Even so, such strict
enforcement policies are not expected to crowd out the tax morale of honest taxpayers,
provided honest taxpayers perceive the stricter policy to be directed mainly against
dishonest taxpayers (Frey, 1997).
       VII. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CENTRAL EASTERN AND
                    FORMER SOVIET UNION COUNTRIES
One of the most interesting features in this research is the transition process of former
Communist countries. Around one quarter of the world population lived in such countries
(see Martinez-Vazquez and McNab, 1997). Frey (2003a) stresses that it is important to
have social capital in terms of mutual trust and honesty in the transition deregulation and
privatization process. Citizens in planned socialist economies, like that of the Soviet
                                                                                          43

"508","Union, were not aware of directly paying taxes (Kornai, 1990). Indeed, during the Soviet
era, ―taxpayers‖ were ―large in size and small in number‖, and the state had many other
levers of control besides taxes (Martinez-Vazquez and Wallace, 1999). However, in a
shift from a centrally controlled to a market economy, the fiscal system needed to be
reformed.     These changes represented significant shocks to ordinary citizens. In
particular, individuals were faced for the first time with the direct payment of taxes,
including being asked to file different tax returns. The transition process brought up
many policy questions, among others: the tax system, the structure of tax administration,
and the degree of political participation. There are numerous research papers regarding
the transition process. However, less evidence is available in regards to tax compliance.
Voluntary compliance and self-filing, two important pillars in a modern tax system, were
completely absent just after the planned socialism (Martinez-Vazquez and McNab, 2000).
Following the early transition, tax evasion and avoidance reached very high levels, as the
new tax administration was not prepared to enforce taxes in a market-based economy
with large numbers of taxpayers. Further, the connection between the payment of taxes
and the provision of public goods had been largely concealed under socialism, which
might have reduced the identification with the state and thus the willingness to pay taxes.
Easter (2007) reports the findings of a poll conducted by the tax administration in the
Tambov region in the early years of the transition, which indicated that only one-third of
the respondents argued that paying taxes to the state would provide any benefit to
themselves. Fiscal concerns might be a key element and it is also often argued that tax
evasion is widespread in transition countries (see, e.g., Alm and Martinez-Vazquez, 2003;
Martinez-Vazquez and McNab, 2000). Alm and Martinez-Vazquez (2003) point out that
―In developing and transition countries (DTCs) in particular, tax evasion is often
widespread and, indeed, systematic. Thus, the problem of tax evasion tends to have far
more serious consequences in DTCs than in developed economies‖ (p. 147). In the
transition process, revenue needs are an important issue. Gordon (1994) points out that in
the reform process, governments in Eastern Europe are confronted with expenditure
needs such as investment demand, infrastructure improvements, and social insurances. In
such situations, the degree of the individuals‘ tax morale might be a key determinant.
Martinez-Vazquez and McNab (1997) argued that it is not surprising to see taxpayers‘
                                                                                        44

"509","resistance movements in the reform process when they are taxed for the first time. The
undeveloped tax administrations, mostly engaged in cash management, were not prepared
to do their work in a modern income tax system. A main problem was the lack of skills
and experience of the tax administration with market-oriented taxes, alongside the failure
of salaries to attract quality personnel to the tax administration profession. Moreover,
weaknesses in the application of tax practices have induced substantial problems.
Unstable tax policies had damaging effects to the economic and social system. Sloppy tax
legislation and the arbitrariness of rulings on behalf of the tax administration (Owsiak,
2007) have reduced state‘s credibility. New procedures have only been implemented
slowly (for an overview see Martinez-Vazquez and McNab, 1997). Casanegra de
Jantscher, Silvani and Vehorn (1992) point out that tax collection problems arise in
transition countries as, e.g., taxpayers are required to ―physically make a trip to either a
tax office, a post office, or a bank‖ (p. 125). This presupposes that these services are
reliable. Furthermore, much greater problems result from the fact that with an increasing
amount of taxpayers it becomes much more difficult to detect tax evaders or avoiders. In
this context it might be interesting to see to which extent tax morale has changed over
time and what shapes tax morale in Central and Eastern European countries (CEE).
        Frey and Torgler (2007) explore differences in tax morale between Western and
Eastern Europe because the reform process in the transition countries caused
disorientation and a heavy economic burden according to Kasper and Streit (1999) and
Gërxhani (2004). The rapid collapse of institutional structures produced a vacuum in
many countries that led to large social costs, especially in terms of worsening income
inequality and poverty rates and bad institutional conditions based on uncertainty and
high transaction costs. The countries in CEE have more secure property rights, because
the transition process occurred earlier and more rapidly. Gërxhani (2004) points out that
many transition countries have an institutional crisis after the collapse of communism.
She argues that an institutional crisis produces a gap between old institutional destruction
and the establishment of new institutions. A reform process imposes high costs of
disorientation and economic burden (Kasper and Streit, 1999). It is thus useful to observe
the development of tax morale as a dependent variable over time, controlling for many
factors. It is interesting to analyze the development over time in various Central and
                                                                                          45
"
"510","Eastern European countries as countries started the course of transition from different
historical backgrounds, physical endowments and reform processes. One of the most
difficult processes is the transformation of social contracts. Stiglitz (1999) points out: ―If
―reformers‖ simply destroy the old norms and constraints in order to ―clean the slate‖
without allowing for the time-consuming processes of reconstructing new norms, then the
new legislated institutions may well not take hold‖ (p. 9). Table A6 reports higher
institutional quality in CEE countries, than in FSU countries using six proxies of the
governance indicators developed by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2004). Thus
individual uncertainty was reduced leading to a better transition process with more stable
institutions. As in many developing countries we might observe that transition countries
are in a situation of ―over-government‖ and ―under-government‖ (Frey and Eichenberger,
1999, p. 89). There is a strong combination of interventionism and bureaucracy. On the
other hand, property rights are not sufficiently secured and there is a high degree of
uncertainty, reducing thus the incentive for investment. For transition countries it is
difficult to find the right equilibrium of state activity, as the collapse of communism was
a collapse of a vast state apparatus. A frequent use of the exit option in form of tax
evasion or tax avoidance by entering the shadow economy has the negative effect of
reducing the state‘s tax collection, affecting thus the revenues governments need to
provide public goods and to build trustworthy institutions. Many countries might react
with the problematic strategy of increasing taxes. This enlarges the shadow economy, as
the incentive for enterprises to evade taxes increases; they just pay, e.g., more bribes to
protect themselves (see Levin and Satarov, 2000). Campos and Coricelli (2002) stress
that reforms progressed much faster in CEE countries than in FSU countries. Moreover,
Martinez-Vazquez and McNab (2000) argue that, in countries negotiating their accession
to the European Union, the accession intention acted as a catalyst for rapid tax reform
shaped along western lines. As a consequence, one would predict significantly lower tax
morale in Former Soviet Union (FSU) economies than in CEE economies. Rose-
Ackerman (2001) reports that citizens are critical regarding the transition process and
state institutions and officials and that the ―sense of stasis is highest for the former parts
of the Soviet Union‖ (p. 419).
                                                                                           46

"511","        Table 2 presents mean tax morale values for transition countries in the first 9
years transition periods based on a scale from 0 to 3, were 3 is the highest tax morale (tax
morale is never justifiable) while value 0 integrates values 4 to 10 (see Torgler, 2003).
CEE countries show a higher tax morale than FSU countries. Furthermore, we can see a
decay of tax morale over time between the years 1990 and 1997. These results are in line
with the registered decline of the living standard in the transition countries. This effect is
much stronger for FSU than for CEE countries. One can also see a high decay of tax
morale in the Baltic countries Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. However, between the years
1995-1997 and 1999-2000, a stabilization of tax morale in the FSU countries and an
increase of tax morale in CEE countries is observed. However, the main disadvantage in
this case is the fact that only a small number of countries participated in all three survey
waves.
        Poland shows a consistent increase of tax morale over time. Kasper and Streit
(1999) point out that Poland‘s strategy after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was a continuous
and systematic institutional transformation without the unnecessarily rapid approach
favored amongst other nations. We find a strong economic growth in the years 1994 to
1997. Between 1989 and 1997 Poland had an average annual rate of GDP growth of 1.6,
which was the highest among the transition countries. Thus, it is not surprising that
Poland in our analysis improved tax morale over time. Kornai (2000) stresses that the
main explanations for the success of development in Poland were the successful macro
stabilization, the bottom-up growth of the private sector, and the inflow of foreign capital.
Furthermore, Poland was the first transition country after Hungary to reform its income
tax (Martinez-Vazquez and McNab, 2000). Several Central and Eastern European
countries have tried in the last decade to simplify their tax systems which may have
contributed to an increase in tax compliance reducing the tax compliance costs (Hayoz
and Hug, 2007). Changes in the tax system in line with developed countries on the road
to integration with the EU (Owsiak, 2007). Interestingly, Bulgaria also shows a strong
increase of tax morale. Bulgaria fell into a depression with a strong decline in the
beginning of the 90s. Between 1989 and 1997, the real GDP fell by 37.2% and
unemployment increased from 2% (1991) to 14% (1997). Furthermore, real living
standards decreased with subsequent reductions in consumption (Bristow, 2000). Bogetić
                                                                                           47
"
"512","(1995) points out that the initial transformation conditions in Bulgaria were more similar
to FSU countries than to CEE countries. Bulgaria had a strong decline in revenues in the
first years after the collapse of traditional tax bases, similar to the countries Albania,
Moldova, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia. However, at the end of 1994 considerable efforts
have been made to liberalize the economy enabling output to commence growing anew.
But Bogetić and Hassan (1997) criticize the income tax development in Bulgaria. The
1993 amendments have complicated the tax system and increased the marginal tax rates
from 40 to 52 %. On the other hand, Martinez-Vazquez (1995) states that in 1994
Bulgaria has already established good revenue assignment systems as, e.g., local own-
source revenues. Looking at the 1999-2000 data for CEE countries we observe low
values from Romania. Uslaner (2007, p. 36) stresses that it ―may not make much sense to
have much faith in the legal system where the courts and the police cannot – or will not –
control corruption or where citizens cannot see that their contribution to the public weal
actually makes the public more wealthy. In this sense, Romania is not exceptional: There
may be less reason for Romanians to have faith in their leaders, who have been unable to
control corruption or to bring its citizens prosperity.‖
        Frey and Torgler (2007) use a multivariate approach to explore country
differences working with the EVS 1999-2000. The estimated coefficient for the Western
Europe dummy, suggests that the institutional crisis in many transition countries in
Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism, tended to affect negatively the tax
morale of citizens. The marginal effects indicate that being a citizen of a Western
European country, rather than an Eastern European country, increases the probability of
responding that tax evasion is never justified by more than 3 percentage points. Frey and
Torgler (2007) also explored single country differences with Table A7 in the Appendix
presenting the results. Country dummies are included in the estimation equation, using
GERMANY as a reference. It is interesting to note that the Central Eastern European
(CEE) countries, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Croatia, and
Poland exhibit higher tax morale than Germany. The coefficient of the first four countries
is statistically significant. Table A7 also reveals that Former Soviet Union (FSU)
countries, such as Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania, Estonia or Latvia have lower tax
morale than Central Eastern European (CEE) countries. It seems that CEE countries have
                                                                                       48

"513","been more successful than FSU countries at designing tax systems, tax administrations,
and government structures in which taxpayers can put their trust. Hence, our results
suggest that CEE countries have been more successful than FSU countries at designing
tax systems, tax administrations, and government structures in which taxpayers can place
their trust. Such institutional improvements and observable changes may help to explain
the higher willingness to cooperate in CEE countries, some of which exhibit higher
values of tax morale than some Western European countries.
         Torgler (2007) explores the differences between CEE and FSU in different stages,
namely in 1989-1993, 1995-1998 and 1999-2001 across 22 transition countries. Using a
multivariate analysis, the study finds that that in most of the three time periods there is a
statistically significant difference between CEE and FSU countries; interestingly, the
difference between CEE and FSU is statistically significant in all specifications. The
marginal effects are much higher in the years 1995-1998, indicating a higher divergence
between the regions. The study also indicates that the respondents originating from a
CEE rather than from a FSU country, increases the probability of stating that ―tax evasion
is never justified‖ by around 13 percentage points (compared to around 2 percentage
points in 1989-1993). Looking at the 1999-2001 data, FSU countries have still
significantly lower tax morale than the CEE countries. However, the marginal effects
have not increased as in the previous years and some are even observed to be lower (close
to 9 percentage points).
         What are the driving forces that shape tax morale in Central Eastern and Former
Soviet Union countries? Trust in the government and the legal system seemed to be key
factors. Governments fulfill a leading role in the transition process; institutional changes
are connected to uncertainty. Institutions provide a reduction of uncertainty by designing
the provided structure of interaction. As a consequence, greater certainty in the political
process is gained. Ensley and Munger (2001) argue that ―if rules are not formalized, the
players may spend too much time arguing over the rules and less time competing in
productive activities‖ (p. 116). And Kasper and Streit (1999) stress that ―Strong
institutional controls and accountability are required to control deeply rooted agent
opportunism. The rule of law has to be imposed on all government agents‖ (p. 432).
Thus, stable and easily knowable institutions help create reliability. A government based
                                                                                          49
"
"514","on a well-functioning democracy produces more trust than a dictatorship. A lack of
public trust undermines state revenues and thus the government‘s ability to perform its
function. Trust in public officials might tend to increase taxpayers‘ positive attitudes and
commitment to the tax system and tax-payment, which finally exerts a positive influence
upon tax compliance. As seen before in the previous sections, institutions taxpayers
perceive as fair and efficient might have a positive effect on tax morale, conditionally
depending on whether society views taxes as a price paid for government‘s positive
actions. Thus, if taxpayers trust their public officials, they are more willing to be honest.
If the government acts trustworthily, taxpayers might be more willing to comply with the
taxes. Similar to the tax administration, the relationship between taxpayers and
government can be seen as a relational contract or psychological contract, which involves
strong emotional ties and loyalties. Such a psychological tax contract can be maintained
by positive actions, based on trust. If the government tries to generate trust with well
functioning institutions, co-operation can be initiated or increased. Furthermore, when
taxpayers are satisfied with the way they are treated, the co-operation is enhanced. If the
outcome received from the government is judged to be fair in relation to the taxes paid,
no distress arises. Raiser, Haerpfer, Nowotny and Wallace (2001) found that in transition
countries, social capital in the form of civic participation and trust in public institutions
has a significant impact on growth. Weakness of the legal system is a major problem in a
process of transition. Levin and Satorov (2000) stress that after the collapse of socialism,
―judicial weakness left a legal vacuum that remains unfilled‖ (p. 120). Thus, as the
transition process gives the opportunity to build new trustworthy institutions, much
weight should be put on developing a trustworthy ground so that taxpayers feel
comfortable with paying taxes. Our results indicate that tax administration and
government are forced to drastically change their structures and their relationship with
taxpayers. As Casanegra de Jantscher et al. (1992) pointed out several years ago: ―A
major challenge for countries in transition will be to develop tax systems that facilitate,
rather than complicate compliance‖ (p. 140).
        Another driving force is corruption. In many former centrally planned economies,
the government and the administration still maintain a strong discretionary power over
the allocation of resources, implicitly enhancing corruption. Levin and Satarov (2000),
                                                                                           50

"515","e.g., analyze corruption and institutions in Russia. They criticize that corruption is an
integral part of Russia‘s economy. Levin and Satarov state that the degree of corruption
exceeds the total expenditures on science, education, health care, culture, and art. In some
industrial branches criminal groups spend up to 50% of their revenues to bribe officials
(p. 115). Tanzi (2002, p. 28) mentions several situations, in which corruption is likely to
be a problem in the tax administration:
        ―-the laws are difficult to understand and can be interpreted differently so that taxpayers
        need assistance in complying with them;
        -the payment of taxes requires frequent contacts between taxpayers and tax
        administrators;
        -the wages of the tax administrators are low;
        -acts of corruption on the part of the tax administrators are ignored, not easily discovered,
        or when discovered penalized only mildly;
        -the administrative procedures (e.g., the criteria for the selection of taxpayers for audits)
        lack transparency and are not closely monitored within the tax or customs
        administrations;
        -tax administrators have discretion over important decisions, such as those related to the
        provision of tax incentives, determination of tax liabilities, selection of audits, litigations,
        and so on‖
In countries where corruption is systemic and the government budget lacks transparency
it cannot be assumed that the obligation of paying taxes is an accepted social norm.
Corruption generally undermines the tax morale of the citizens who become frustrated.
Taxpayers will feel cheated if they believe that corruption is widespread and their tax
burden is not spent well. Corrupt bureaucracy will not award the services to the most
efficient producers, but to the producers which offers the largest bribes. Thus, corruption
reduces the efficiency of allocation and produces delays in transactions to acquire
additional payments (see, e.g., Rose-Ackerman, 1997; Jain, 2001).
        Figure 3 visualizes this point, checking the correlation between tax morale and
the corruption ratings commonly used in the literature. We use an average value
developed by Abed and Davoodi (2002, p.502), based on the rankings of the
                                                                                                     51

"516","Transparency International, the Political Risk Service, the International Risk Guide, and
the Business International. Focusing only on the corruption ratings one should note a
higher values go in line with lower corruption. We observe a highly positive correlation
between the corruption ratings and the tax morale, including 19 countries (r=0.610,
significant at the 0.01 level). In other words, a higher level of tax morale is correlated
with lower corruption. This result is consistent with Uslaner (2007) in showing that high
levels of perceived corruption are associated with high levels of tax evasion.
         Torgler (2007b) using a multivariate analysis indicates that there is a significant
negative correlation between tax morale and the perceived size of corruption. The
advantage of this study is that perceived corruption was collected at the individual level.
The use of ‗perceived corruption‘ is in line with other indexes employing measures of
perceptions (such as the Transparency International index). However, perceptions are not
objective, nor are they quantitative measures of the actual degree of corruption. Rather,
perceptions are an indirect mechanism for measuring corruption (Tanzi, 2002). However
Treisman (2000, pp. 410-411), in his analysis of the Transparency International index,
was able to present valid arguments as to why data based on perceptions should be taken
seriously. Components of the surveys and ratings are highly correlated among
themselves, even though they have been conducted with different methodologies,
different inputs and in different time periods. Such consistency allows us to conclude that
factors are almost free of biases such as a ―temporal mood‖ or guesses. A practical
method by which one can test whether the World Values Survey question about the
perceived corruption is through the use of a useful proxy to check whether the variable is
correlated with other well-known indexes on corruption. Thus, comparing the WVS
variable with the corruption indexes TI (Transparency International), International
Country Risk Guide (ICRG) and Quality of Government (Control of Corruption)
developed by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2004). The WVS corruption ratings
(higher values=lower corruption) are highly correlated with the TI (r= -0.878), the ICRG
(r=-0.680) and the Quality of Government rating (r=-0.827)12. Torgler‘s (2007b) results
indicate that an increase in the perceived level of corruption by one unit increases the
12
   The sign is negative because for all three ratings used (TI, ICRG and Quality of Government), a higher
score corresponds to a lower corruption.
                                                                                                      52

"517","share of subjects indicating the highest tax morale by more than 1.7 percentage points.
Thus, a higher degree of perceived corruption crowds out tax morale. If taxpayers notice
that many public officials are corrupt and many other taxpayers evade taxes, they might
get the feeling that their intrinsic motivation is not recognized or honored. Thus,
taxpayers get the feeling that they too can be opportunistic. The moral costs to evade
taxes decrease.
         Interestingly, Torgler (2003) also observe that the self-employed have a lower tax
morale than full-time employees. This result is not surprising, especially in transition
countries where self-employed individuals are confronted with and restricted by high
transaction costs imposed by unduly inefficient government activities13. States‘ position
and its reputation was affected due to numerous mistakes in the tax practices since the
beginning of the transformation process: ―The state‘s attitude in many instances can be
described as blatantly irresponsible. This usually took the form of continuously modified
tax policy concepts (partially implemented). When observing the politicians‘ behavior in
the area of taxes, one could get the impression that they juggled with tax instruments
without fully realizing that these ―toys‖ could go off one day. This attitude is typical of
almost all governments of post-communist countries where the applied fiscal tools fail to
ensure financial stability but their reform is opposed by the society‖ (Owsiak, 2007, p.
202). This induced a higher level of tax awareness, reputation costs, and a higher
sensibility towards unfair treatments: ―All attempts to improve the tax system on the part
of the state are treated with suspicion and highly criticized by the media‖ (p. 194).
                                    VIII. CONCLUSIONS
It seems to be important to consider the moral dimension of complying with societies‘
rules, underlying legal structure and countries‘ security of property rights. A failure of a
country‘s legal system undermines tax morale and tax compliance. Also, regulatory
restraints and bureaucratic procedures limit the operation of markets, enhancing the
13
   Djankov et al. (2002) show with data from 75 countries that in general heavier regulation of entry goes in
line with a higher corruption and a higher shadow economy. On the other hand, countries with more
democratic and limited governments have less entry regulations.
                                                                                                          53

"518","incentives to act in the shadow economy or to evade taxes. A more legitimate and
responsive state appears to be an essential precondition in generating compliance. If
individual and business contracts are not enforced and productive efforts not protected,
the incentive to be active illegally increases. Citizens feel cheated if corruption is
widespread, their tax burden is not spent well, and that they are not protected by the rules
of law. Such a situation also increases the incentive not be compliant. Discussing tax
reforms in transition Owsiak (2007, p. 223) stresses that ―reforms under way in post-
communist countries should not, at the present stage of in-depth restructuring of the
economy, rely exclusively on tax cuts but instead should concentrate on measures
enhancing citizen trust in law and on the removal of sources of tax-related abuse. The
establishment of a legal framework that would render the tax system stable, transparent,
simple, friendly to taxpayers, accompanied by concurrent implementation of a rational
mechanism for allocating and controlling public spending, highlighting the relation
between collected taxes and the benefits gained by local communities, would ultimately
determine whether society will welcome the development of tax-related civil behavioral
patterns‖ (p. 223). Evidence in the tax morale literature indicates that positive attitudes
towards the tax authority and tax system significantly increase tax morale. A respectful
and fair treatment of taxpayers induces respect for the tax system and thus leads to co-
operation. On the other hand, a higher perceived tax burden and inefficiencies and
unfairness in the interaction between the tax administration and the taxpayers crowds out
the intrinsic motivation to pay taxes. International evidence also shows that instead of
focusing so much on compliance management, risk control, or structuring the application
of enforcement discretion, it may make sense if the tax administration becomes more
focused on service, customers, quality, transparency and process improvement.
        Social norms or social capital are key factors in understanding the motivation for
compliance in transition countries and other regions. Moreover, social capital seems to be
an important determinant of economic phenomena like macroeconomic performance. For
example, Knack and Keefer (1997) find, in a cross-sectional analysis, a strong and
significantly positive relationship between social capital variables (civic duty) and
economic growth. Schaltegger and Torgler (2007), using data for a synthetic panel of
Swiss cantons over the 1981–2001 period, show that accountability enhances fiscal
                                                                                         54

"519","performance. As Slemrod (1998) argues, social capital – measured as the willingness to
pay taxes voluntarily – lowers the cost of government operations and of equitably
assigning such cost to citizens. Such research justifies a closer look at social capital and
societal institutions. A high level of governance and institutional quality allows one to
express one‘s own preferences, involvement and participation in the political process. It
also enhances identification with the state‘s institutions, counteracting inclinations to be
non-compliant. Participation and identification therefore reduce free-rider problems. If
citizens and authorities interact with a sense of collective responsibility under inspiring
institutional structures, the system may be better governed and the policies more
effective, as accountability promotes effectiveness through its impact on government
behavior (Schaltegger and Torgler, 2007). The institutional architecture and governance
quality seem to be a key component in the understanding of tax morale, the shadow
economy and tax performance.
         Changes in the political system have a substantial impact on tax morale. This can
be seen as an indicator that tax morale does not remain stable over time. Moreover, social
norms are not only shaped by formal and informal institutions but also by social
interactions. Evidence shows that if taxpayers believe tax evasion to be common, their
tax morale decreases. In contrast, if they believe others to be honest, their tax morale
increases. Results also indicate that social learning explains the observed conformity and
compliance with social norms after the unification of Germany. Tax morale within
Germany had slowly converged after unification and it seems that the convergence
process has been driven by a change in tax morale among East German individuals. As a
further natural experiment it may be interesting to look at tax morale changes over time
in the Czech and Slovak Republics due to the separation in 1992.
         In general, in most of the studies on tax morale and tax compliance, research has
focused on personal income tax. Business tax evasion has received very little attention.
This is a surprise taking into account the economic importance of the business sector and
the importance of business taxation for tax administrations. Work in this area is therefore
highly relevant for transition countries as results indicate that self-employed taxpayers
have a lower tax morale. Working with the Business Environment and Enterprise
                                                                                          55

"520","Performance Survey could provide further valuable insights (see, e.g., Hellman and
Kaufmann, 2002; Uslaner, 2010).
        No matter how good political institutions may be, however, countries will always
encounter difficulties in dealing with distributive issues. How one thinks about taxes and
inequality reflects ideas of fairness or social justice (Bird et al., 2006). Income inequality
is a central social and economic problem in many transition countries. Surprisingly, the
link between income inequality and tax morale, tax compliance and tax performance is
not well explored. As inequality in the distribution of wealth and income is strongly
connected with public views as to how well the fiscal system addresses social objectives
with respect to fairness, social justice and redistribution, a higher level of income
inequality may lead to lower levels of trust in institutions and eventually to lower tax
effort because of widespread tax avoidance and evasion. Highly unequal distributions of
income can also lead to low levels of solidarity by the elites toward lower income groups.
Furthermore, income inequality may be associated with political instability (Alesina and
Perotti, 1996). It may therefore be interesting to explore empirically the link between
income inequality and tax morale/tax compliance and tax performance in transition
countries (exploring also CEE and FSU countries independently).
        In addition, it is important to better understand tax administration‘s behavior, its
behavior and its structure in CEE and FSU countries over time. Results in the literature
indicate that if the tax administration tries to be honest, fair, informative, and helpful,
acting as a service institution and thus treating taxpayers as partners and not inferiors in a
hierarchical relationship, tax morale increases and taxpayers have stronger incentives to
pay taxes honestly. One could, e.g., conduct surveys with tax administrations to generate
further insights.
        In summary, the findings clearly indicate the relevance of models of tax
compliance that go beyond the conventional economics-of-crime approach and which
capture the role of institutions, more in particular, how individuals perceive their
governments, in explaining why individuals pay taxes. The report indicates the
importance of accountability, democratic governance, efficient, and transparent legal
structures and therefore trust within the society to enforce tax compliance and tax morale.

Notes: Tendencies: - Reduction of the shadow economy, always statistically significant.. (+) and (-) mostly or
sometimes statistically significant ((+)), ((-)), (almost) never statistically significant. Econometric specification:
SHADOWit =  + 1 CTRLit +2 GOVINSTit +3 TAXMORALEit+ TDt +REGIONi + it, where i indexes the countries
in the sample, SHADOWit denotes countries‘ size of the shadow economy as a percentage of the official GDP over the
periods 1990, 1995 and 2000. GOVINSTit are indicators for governance and institutional quality and TAXMit the level
of tax morale. CTRLi are the control variables (see table). To control for time as well as regional invariant factors, we
include fixed time, TDt, and fixed regional effects, REGIONi differentiating between developed, Asian and developing
or transition countries. it denotes the error term.

Notes: Number of observations: 31‘857. Tax morale as a dependent variable (four-point scale from 0 to 3). The results are presented with robust standard errors. The symbols *, **,
*** represent statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively. The table report the marginal effects of the highest tax morale score (3). Recognizing that including
aggregated country variables produces downwardly biased standard errors, we address the problem of heteroscedasticity by presenting standard errors adjusted for clustering on cantons
in the lower part of the table. The estimation controls for a large set of control variables (socio-demographic, occupation and marital status, religiosity, conditional cooperation,
Western Europe dummy).

Notes: a Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (10= highly clean, 1= highly corrupt). b Source Kaufmann
et al. (2004). Values between –2.5 and 2.5, with higher scores corresponding to better institutions (outcomes). c The higher
the rating, the lower the risk and vice versa, see Knack (1999). d Higher GINI coefficient implies more inequality (source:
Galbraith and Kum 2005). e The scores range from 1 to 5 (1=environment/set of policies are most conducive to economic
freedom, 5= least conducive), see 2005 Index of Economic Freedom handbook, chapter 5 (see
http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/. f The Democracy indicator is an additive eleven-point scale (0-10). Regime
Durability: number of years since the most recent regime change or the end of transition period defined by the lack of stable
political institutions (see http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/polity/). g Higher ethnic score implies a stronger ethnic
fractionalization (source: Alesina et al., 2003).

Notes: Compliance rate (declared income/obtained income). The experimental design replicates most of the
elements of the basic structure of the personal income tax system in the study countries, as described in
Table 4. In the experiment, individuals receive income, pay taxes on income voluntarily reported and face
a probability of audit. If they are detected cheating, individuals must pay a financial penalty on taxes not
reported. Of course, incarceration is not a possible penalty in the experimental setting. There are three
basic fiscal parameters that affect decisions on tax compliance: tax rate, probability of detection, and
penalty (or fine) rate. The maintained hypothesis is that risk attitudes are the same across the cultures being
investigated. This is tested with a willingness to bear risk experiment and confirmed with the results being
reported below. The experimental setting controls for tax rate, probability of detection, and penalty rates.
The different pools are subjected to the same parameters. Thus, the observed differences in tax compliance
behavior are interpreted as being motivated by: differences in those institutional features affecting attitudes
toward the government (the fiscal exchange) and by other possible factors that may be described as
differences in the inhibitors or social norms across the countries. To the extent that social norms can be
influenced by the same factors that affect attitudes toward government, or by the perceived fiscal exchange,
the maintained hypothesis is that all these factors can be represented by the perceptions about government
fairness.

Notes: Mean values in these three time periods, calculated as the simple average across all individuals in the
data sets. We observe a significant decay of tax morale between 1991 and 1995, from 1.86 to 1.66. (Recall
that a higher number indicates higher tax morale.) In the next four years tax morale recovered, with an
increase from 1.66 to 1.73. Thus, we observe on average a decline in the willingness to pay taxes during the
first 4 years of the transition and a less than full recovery in the following 4 years.

                               Executive
                                          summary
            While most taxpayers comply with their tax obligations, some are determined not to. Tax
            evasion and tax fraud continues to occur and can be substantial, amounting to many
            billions per year. Not only is this against the law and defrauds the government of revenue,
            but it also creates an un-level playing field for compliant taxpayers.
            Many tax authorities around the world are seeing particular types of tax evasion: under-
            reporting of income through electronic sales suppression and over-reporting of deductions
            through false invoicing. Tax evasion and fraud can be further facilitated by the cash
            economy and the sharing (or online) economy.
            However, cost effective technology solutions are already available for tax authorities to

            This report draws on the experience of 21 countries in this area, including several
            developing countries, and highlights their key successes in using these technology tools.
            Not only has substantial tax revenue been raised due to the reduction in tax evasion and
            tax fraud, but where these solutions have been implemented; a deterrent effect is shown,
            with overall increasing compliance by taxpayers.
            This report has been prepared with a view to encouraging other tax authorities to consider
            whether the same approach may be effective in their jurisdiction. It is the second in a
            series of reports focusing on the use of technology and digital solutions to address tax
            evasion, the first being the report Electronic Sales Suppression: A threat to tax revenue (OECD,
            2013).

  Chapter 1
       Introduction: A compelling case
   Tax evasion and fraud is illegal and intentional misrepresentation of tax obligations. It can
   involve deliberate omission or falsification of income or revenue, as well as efforts to be
   invisible to tax authorities altogether. This results in the reduction of income that lawfully
   belongs to the government, and to the people. The loss of income can be substantial; for
   example, a study by European Commission reported that the total VAT Gap for 26 EU
   countries amounted to approximately EUR 193 billion in the year 2011 alone.
   Tax evasion and tax fraud not only cheats the public of revenue that is to be used for
   public goods, but also puts compliant taxpayers that obey the law at a disadvantage. It
   makes it harder for those compliant businesses to be profitable when they are competing
   with businesses that do not bear the expense of paying their fair share of taxes.
   Two particular types of tax evasion and tax fraud appear to be widespread in their use:
   underreporting of income through sales suppression and over-reporting of deductions
   through false invoicing. These are simple for criminals to achieve and can affect countries
   of all sizes. These types of tax evasion and fraud can be further facilitated by the cash
   economy and sharing economy. The impact of this tax crime is huge, with anecdotal
   evidence alone indicating that it amounts to many billions of dollars in lost tax revenue.
   In the past, underreporting of income and over-reporting of deductions were difficult and
   time consuming for tax authorities to detect. This is changing. Many tax authorities are
   now using technology solutions to detect these tax crimes. These solutions have been
   effective, and these tax authorities are making progress in bringing previously undetected
   and lost income into the revenue base, in a way that is also resource efficient for the tax
   authority. As more solutions become available in the market and the costs reduce, tax
   authorities have an opportunity to prevent and detect crime, significantly improve their
   revenue collection and increase the efficiency of their operations.
   For this reason, the Task Force on Tax Crime and Other Crimes (TFTC) called for a report to
   publicise the importance and effectiveness of technology solutions that are being used to
   detect tax fraud and evasion. This report was based on survey responses and discussions
   with 21 tax authorities1 on the solutions they are using or putting in place, as well as
   publicly available information and consultation with the private sector providers of the
   relevant technology solutions.

            This report is not intended to be a comprehensive picture of all technology solutions
            being used by tax authorities around the world. Rather, it gives a clear picture of the
            direction that a number of tax authorities are taking, and should lead to further work on
            sharing information on other technology solutions as they emerge.
            The report is divided into two sections. The first provides a brief overview of the types
            of technology tools that tax administrations have implemented to address tax evasion
            and tax fraud problems. Looking first at electronic sales suppression and then at false
            invoicing, it describes the problem, the key features of the technology solutions being
            used to address the problem, the results, and the complementary tools used to implement
            the solutions. The report then considers complementary work that is being undertaken
            to address the cash economy and sharing economy, which, although not types of tax
            evasion and fraud themselves, can facilitate it.

            solutions being used to address electronic sales suppression and false invoicing, with a
            view to allowing other tax administrations that are facing the same types of challenges
            to draw on that experience.
            The report concludes that the case for the use of technology to assist in countering
            tax fraud and evasion is compelling. To make the best use of these available tools, tax
            authorities must continue to be proactive in sharing experience in order to stay abreast
            of the tax evasion and fraud techniques as they continue to evolve.

"558","                   TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
   Chapter 2
        Electronic sales suppression and counter-technology
    At a basic level, sales suppression can be as simple as not recording some cash sales
    with the intention of under-reporting the amount of sales and thereby under-reporting
    the corresponding tax liability. However, more sophisticated methods have become
    very prevalent. With the increased use of technology in businesses, and the increased
    use of electronic payment forms such as debit cards, sales suppression is also being
    undertaken through electronic tools that can alter evidence of transactions whether paid
    in cash or card, without leaving a trace of the alteration. These transactions can also be
    underreported by using the cash register in training mode, or cancelling transactions
    after they have occurred. Without the correct data, tax authorities cannot assess the
    correct tax.
    In the past, sales suppression could be achieved simply through putting cash straight
    into your pocket or editing the accounting books. Now, sales suppression has become
    more sophisticated through the use of technology which makes it much harder for
    administrations to detect. The two main electronic sales suppression tools that are used
    are phantomware and zappers.
    Phantomware involves the installation of software as part of the sales register. It allows a
    program to operate on the sales register which can alter the data that has been recorded.
    The program is only accessible through a hidden menu which allows the business owner
    to covertly manipulate the sales records after the transaction has occurred.
    A zapper is an external device or external program accessed online that can be connected
    to the cash register. When connected to a cash register, it allows the manipulation of
    transaction records, performing a similar function to phantomware.
    Both phantomware and zappers allow the user to delete individual sales records altogether
    and also to substitute the sales amounts to a lower figure and thereby reducing the overall
    sales. Because of their concealed nature, the cash register appears to users to operate
    normally and poses a challenge to tax auditors to detect.
    New sales suppression techniques have emerged. Referred to as “sales suppression as a
    service”, this tool allows a taxpayer to achieve sales suppression through a foreign zapper
    which operates over the internet. The service provides deletion, alteration and replacement
    of sales data or remote crashing of the hard drive. This can be very difficult for the tax
    authority to detect as it otherwise appears authentic, or appears not to be attributable to
    any actions of the taxpayer. Often the service provider is in a foreign jurisdiction, making
    it difficult for domestic authorities to take enforcement action.

"559","                         ELECTRONIC SALES SUPPRESSION AND COUNTER-TECHNOLOGY
         What solutions can address electronic sales suppression?
            Where tax crime is facilitated by technology, a technology response is needed. The most
            common counter-suppression tool used to address electronic sales suppression is data
            recording technology. This tool records and secures the sales data immediately as the
            transaction occurs and stores it in a manner that means it is tamper proof. This means
            it cannot be manipulated by phantomware or zappers, or if tampering has occurred, it is
            traceable and detectable. The data should be stored securely and preserved even if there
            is loss of power.
            There are different types of tools that are being used to perform this function, which
            are referred to in different countries and by different service providers as a fiscal control
            unit, electronic fiscal device, fiscal memory device, sales data controller or sales recording
            module. This type of technology should be able to be used in any type of cash register, such
            as traditional electronic cash registers (ECRs), computer-based point of sales systems, or
            those that are tablet or smartphone-based. Different solutions are available which can
            either be included as an integrated part of a cash register, or as an add-on installed with
            an existing cash register.
            As an additional feature, these types of tools are also being used to send data automatically
            to the tax authority, connecting cash registers online to their data server systems. This
            can occur either in real time or in bulk scheduled transfers, such as at the end of the day
            or each month. The tax authority then has the opportunity to access the data remotely
            for compliance and audit purposes.
         What are the results and benefits?
            Results from these devices have been impressive their ability to bring previously untaxed
            amounts into the revenue base.
                                                                                     In Hungary,

"560","                   TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
     Box 1. Highlights of results from electronic data recording technology
     In Austria, results from the electronic sales suppression tools are expected to be an additional
     EUR 900 million in tax revenues.
     In Belgium, initial comparisons shows an 8% increase in restaurant sales reported after installation
     of their solution as with sales reported before.
     In Quebec in Canada, At 31 March 2016, CAD 1.2 billion (EUR 822 million) in taxes was recovered
     following the introduction of sales recording modules into the restaurant industry. Projections are
     that, by 2018-2019, this will cumulatively amount to CAD 2.1 billion (EUR 1.44 billion). In addition
     to tax losses, in 2008 the Canadian Revenue Agency criminally charged the owners of four
     restaurants with tax evasion involving the “zapping” of nearly 200 000 cash transactions, totaling
     EUR 3.1 million.
     In Hungary, electronic cash registers were installed with a fiscal control unit. After the first year
     of operation, VAT revenue increased by 15% in the concerned sectors. The increase in VAT
     revenues has exceeded the overall costs of the project of introducing the new systems.
     In Rwanda, electronic cash registers were introduced in March 2013. In 2015, VAT collected on
     sales had increased by 20%.
     In Sweden, since 2010, 135 000 cash registers are connected to a fiscal control unit. This
     includes all companies selling goods and services paid in cash. Increased VAT and income
     tax revenues has been estimated to around SEK 3 billion (EUR 300 million) per annum since
     the legislation was implemented. The legislation has also led to better control measures for the
     Swedish Tax Agency.
   There are also benefits for businesses. For instance, tools that prevent the manipulation of
   sales data and ensure secure accurate reporting will also protect from theft by employees.
   In addition, tools that accurately record and store data and share it with the tax authority
   can reduce the burdens of an audit for both the tax authority and the taxpayer.
   For example, in the province of Quebec the time required to audit a restaurant used to
   take 70 hours, but after the introduction of their sales recording module, it now takes three
   hours. This allowed the tax authority to significantly increase the number of inspections
   from 120 to 8000 per year. This can be beneficial for business, as the audit can occur
   electronically and remotely rather than at the business and requiring the production of
   volumes of hard copy documents, meaning reduced time and interruption to the business.

             What features do these solutions have?
                Common regulatory and design features of these solutions include:
                             Table 2.1 Key features of data recording technology solutions
            Feature            Benefits
            Regulation         Ensures that the cash registers that are authorised for use are only those that have the
            and                requisite functions (and do not have prohibited functions that allow sales suppression).
            certification of   One mechanism for doing this is to license only certain market vendors of cash registers.
            cash registers     Another mechanism is to introduce regulations that detail the specifications that must be
                               present in cash registers, and allowing the market to provide solutions that meet these
                               requirements.
            Data content       Prescribing the details of what data must be recorded and printed on the purchase receipt
            requirements       ensures that the information is useful to the tax administration for verification and for
                               compliance action.
                               This data can be defined as fiscal data and can include the amount of the sale, amount
                               of VAT / sales tax due, time, date, invoice number, the mode of operation that the register
                               was in (such as training mode), and the type of receipt (such as refund or a non-final bill
                               in a restaurant).
            Data security:     A digital signature or a control code provides a unique identifier with the details of the
            Digital            transaction such as date, time and amount of the transaction. The digital signature or
            signature of       control code is stored with the transaction data and also printed on the customer’s receipt.
            receipt            The signature can be encrypted or a certificate e-signature, for which the tax authority has
                               the corresponding key to identify the creator of the data.
                               Digital signatures allow each transaction to be traced and verified, because the unique
                               identifier guarantees that the data has been generated by the particular taxpayer and has
                               not been altered since the signature was created. If the transaction is subsequently altered,
                               a different digital signature identifier will be generated, leaving a trace of the change.
            Data storage       Data must be stored separately and securely from the cash register in a tamper proof
                               environment to prevent manipulation or hacking. The data should be stored at the point
                               the transaction occurs.
                               The data can be stored on an external device that is connected to the cash register
                               (a “black box”), fully integrated inside the cash register or the receipt printer (such as a
                               microchip or sim card), or connected to and stored in cloud-based solutions.
            Online data        Where the tax authority has remote access to the information at any time, it deters
            accessibility:     taxpayers from subsequently altering records. It also allows the tax authority to use the
            Remote             data for audit case selection and in compliance activities, and may make such activities
            access             more efficient as the data is already available without having to send a specific request
            by the tax         or attend an on-site audit examination. This also assists tax authorities where data may
            administration     otherwise be stored offshore which can pose challenges for audit.
            Data               Regular data transmission of the records to the tax authority deters taxpayers from altering

                               suitable in places where reliable connectivity is not in place, and may in some cases be
                               more manageable for the tax authority.

                               without having to send a specific request or attend an on-site audit examination. This
                               also assists tax authorities where data may otherwise be stored offshore which can pose
                               challenges for audit.

"562","                   TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
     The above described features can be combined in a counter-suppression technical solution
     in different ways. Important aspects to consider when choosing a solution is the degree
     of data security (encryption or e-signing) and tamper proof storage; whether to store
     the secured fiscal data in an external add-on device (a fiscal box) or fully integrated as a
     module inside the cash register. Requiring certification of solutions and cash registers will
     simplify and enforce compliance.
     A more detailed summary of solutions implemented by some countries is included in
     Annex A.
    What are the costs?
     A key factor in making a technology choice that will be as affordable, effective and easy to
     implement as possible is to assess the structure of a jurisdiction’s cash register market, in
     particular the range of cash registers in use in different market sectors, from traditional
     simple cash registers to more sophisticated point of sales equipment. This can make it
     easier to determine how many cash registers could be upgraded or replaced and the
     technology price range accordingly.
     Costs of these types of solutions have been decreasing over time. Many solutions being used
     are off-the-shelf solutions that can be installed by the taxpayer, or are already installed
     in certified cash registers. Factors that can affect the costs of the solution include the
     degree of modification required to existing machines (as modification of existing systems
     can be more expensive than adding on a separate component), the size of the market
     that is implementing the solution, and whether the solution is procured through the open
     market. Although it is difficult to generalise, costs can be as low as under EUR 30 and up
     to around EUR 1 000.
     The costs to the tax authority should also be considered. This should include giving
     consideration to the most effective means of enforcing the implementation of the
     technology solution, including the extent to which the tax administration is itself
     responsible for technical aspects such as certifying individual cash registers, or inspecting
     bespoke modifications to existing machines. In addition, the costs for the tax authority
     of either remotely accessing or receiving and storing bulk transaction data should be
     considered. In either case, automated data analytics tools could be considered to detect
     patterns, anomalies or gaps, which would reduce the costs of detecting any unusual
     results.
    What other actions are needed to implement the solution?
     The degree and type of other tools needed to implement data recording technology
     solutions may depend on the domestic legal framework, such as the regulatory power of
     the tax authority and the extent to which there is evidence of electronic sales suppression
     in the country that justifies the introduction of mandatory technology tools. In most cases,

            the legal framework will be at the heart of any solution. Additional tasks that should be
            considered when introducing a technology tool include consultation with taxpayers and
            the private sector, incentives to taxpayers, legislation and regulatory, as well as monitoring
            and enforcement. These tools can be used in conjunction and are not mutually exclusive.
            Further examples on each are included below.

                                           Monitoring           Enforcement
               · L egislation to require the production of invoices for every transaction, together
                  with legislation requiring the use of data recording technology or cash register
                  that are compliant with specified standards. The technical requirements should
                  be very clear and its implementation easily able to be verified. Legislation can
                  also specify how cash registers should be used, such as prohibitions on using
                  cash registers in training mode which prevents transactions being recorded or
                  providing restrictions on how refunds should be recorded to ensure transactions
                  are not falsely reversed as a refund where the taxpayer keeps the payment.
                  Examples: Austria’s Fiscal Procedure Code, Sweden’s Cash Registers Act.
               · C onsultation and collaboration with taxpayers and the providers of cash registers
                  is beneficial when defining the appropriate standards.
                  Examples: the Netherlands worked with the industry to develop a set of “quality
                  marks” which are indictors of reliable cash registers. The state of Ontario in Canada
                  is undertaking a public consultation with businesses and others to obtain input
                  on technology solutions can address electronic sales suppression, in ways that
                  minimise the burden for industry.

   · I ncentives for business to voluntarily install data recording technology, such as
     an enhanced tax deduction, subsidised costs or linking the use of compliant cash
     registers to a reduced likelihood of audit.
     Examples: Austria provides a special tax deduction upon the taxpayer reporting
     to the tax authority that they have installed the required device. Experience has
     shown that even where the government pays for the systems to be used, this is paid
     for very quickly in the revenue results.
   · C ompliance awareness among customers such as a receipt lottery. This encourages
     awareness amongst the public of the risk of tax evasion and tax fraud through
     the misuse of invoices, and enables them to act as an enforcement mechanism,
     giving taxpayers a business incentive to comply. An extra incentive can apply where
     customers can enter their receipt into a lottery or accumulate points for each receipt
     submitted, giving them a chance to win a prize.
     Examples: Colombia and Portugal.
   · M onitoring the introduction of the new technology. This can include requiring
     suppliers of the cash registers to report to the tax authority to certify that their
     products meet the specifications, and / or requiring taxpayers to report when they
     have installed a compliant data recording technology device. The tax authority
     could then maintain a register or database to assist in follow up audits.
     Example: In Sweden a person possessing a cash register must report this to the tax
     authority, and each cash register has a unique identification number.
   · E
      nforcement, such as legislation and penalties for using or distributing electronic
     sales suppression devices to deter and penalise both the use and the supply of
     sales suppression technology.
     Examples: almost 20 states in the United States have enacted such legislation. This
     must be supported by effective audit strategies to detect non-compliance with the
     requirements and ability to enforce penalties.

     Whereas sales suppression techniques seek to under-report              in domestic invoicing
     revenue, false invoicing seeks to over-report deductions, and                      fraud
     to falsify invoices to mask non-deductible personal expenses
                                                                                    * 2014-2015 data
     as legitimate deductions. False invoicing occurs where a business
     fabricates or inflates invoices which name the business as the debtor.
     This allows it to fraudulently claim expenses for tax purposes that have not been incurred.
     Although in theory a tax authority can verify the validity of each invoice by comparing it
     to the records of the counterparty to the transaction, it is time consuming and resource
     intensive to do so.
       Box 2. Estimated impact of false invoicing
       Between 2007 and 2009 Mexico lost just under EUR 3 billion in tax revenue due to forged
       invoices.
       In the Slovak Republic, during the years 2014 and 2015 the amount of risky VAT detected in
       domestic invoicing fraud was more than EUR 500 million.
    What solutions can address false invoicing?
     A solution to address the problem of false invoicing is requiring electronic invoicing.
     Generally businesses must retain records of transactions with customers and provide an
     invoice to a customer, either in electronic or paper form. An electronic invoice documents
     the transaction in electronic format. The electronic invoicing system should have
     additional features to ensure the integrity of the data and the identity of the creator. This
     can be done by using a digital signature to ensure authenticity of the invoice and that it
     has not been altered after its creation.
     Electronic invoicing will be most effective where the invoices must be registered or
     otherwise provided to the tax authority. The detection of false over-reporting of deductible
     expenses can be achieved by automatic matching of the data for the purchaser and seller.
     Where this is undertaken through periodic or real time data transfers, the tax authority
     has substantially enhanced visibility of its taxpayers, and can perform audits, analytics
     and tax return functions in an efficient way.

         What are the results and benefits?
            Electronic invoicing has been implemented in a number of countries, with evidence
            beginning to be collected on its impact. For example, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
            Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Italy, the People’s Republic of China, Peru, Rwanda
            and Uruguay have implemented electronic invoicing. The impact in Mexico alone was
            that mandatory electronic invoicing in Mexico brought 4.2 million
            micro‑businesses into the formal economy.
                                                                                                      Mandatory
            Electronic invoicing can have the additional benefit of                            electronic invoicing
            replacing paper invoices, eliminating the need to print, send

         What features do these solutions have?
            Common features of electronic invoicing are shown in Table 3.1.:
                              Table 3.1 Key features of electronic invoicing solutions
             Feature                              Benefits
             Standardising the requirements of    Specifying the requirements such as the content or format, or
             electronic invoices                  certifying the providers of electronic invoicing solutions gives
                                                  quality assurance and ease of audit. It also makes the widespread
                                                  introduction of electronic invoicing clear and consistent for
                                                  businesses.
                                                  Where one standardised format is required, this can make the
                                                  automatic processing and analysis of bulk data easier for the tax
                                                  authority.
             Digital signature of receipt         Signature provides a unique identifier with the details of the
                                                  transaction such as date, time and amount of the transaction. The
                                                  tax authority has the matching key to decrypt the signature and
                                                  can determine if the receipt is complete and authentic.
                                                  If the transaction is subsequently altered, a different digital signature
                                                  identifier will be generated, leaving a trace of the change. Using a
                                                  digital signature is therefore an important aspect of also being able
                                                  to verify invoices.

    What other actions are needed to implement the solution?
     As with electronic sales suppression, technology is not a standalone solution, but
     features as part of a package. To make the introduction of electronic invoicing effective,
     the following complementary features have been used:
        · L egislation requiring electronic invoices, supported by penalties for failure to do so.
           This could be supported by legislation allowing the tax authority to access third
           party data to match payment flows to taxpayers.
        · O nline verification tools. Example: in Argentina, after the transaction is approved the
           taxpayer has to apply to the tax authority for authorisation. If the invoice contains
           the required information, it is authorised as valid and has fiscal effects against third
           parties. The information is kept in the database of the tax authority which can be
           used to subsequently cross-check other tax reporting and collection. In addition,
           third parties can access a verification tool online, in which they can enter the
           details of the invoice they have received and instantly verify that it matches the
           information already registered with the tax authority and therefore know whether
           it can be relied upon for tax and other purposes.
        · A ligning the requirements for the format and content of the electronic invoices to
           other tax record keeping and reporting obligations, or using it to pre-fill returns, can
           streamline the compliance burden for businesses. Another approach that has been
           used is to provide relief from tax penalties in the event of an audit provided that the
           business has implemented the required invoicing tool.
        · I ncentives for taxpayers, such as providing software to assist. Examples: in Italy the
           Revenue Agency is making software available to businesses for free from July 2016
           to conduct electronic invoicing in business to business transactions enabling the
           operators (especially the micro-small enterprises) to create, transmit and store the
           electronic invoices. In Chile, the government provides online accounting software
           which allows small businesses to record transactions and generate pre-filled tax
           returns. Negative incentives can also be used, such as making the use of electronic
           invoicing a requirement for the business and the customer to be entitled to claim a
           deduction in respect of certain transactions or claim input credits for value added
           taxes. Example: in Italy, the option to electronically transmit invoices would relieve
           the taxpayer from existing reporting obligations, which is expected to significantly
           reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.
     Since taxpayers are generally required to maintain business records, the introduction of
     electronic invoicing may not be a significant departure from existing obligations. Where
     businesses are currently using paper based record keeping, the introduction of electronic
     invoicing can bring benefits of greater accuracy and efficiency, particularly where the
     electronic invoicing system can be used to easily fulfil other tax compliance obligations.
     A more detailed summary of solutions implemented by some countries is included in
     Annex B.

   Chapter 4
       The cash economy and the sharing economy:
                          Complementary work to address the risks
    What are the challenges posed by the cash economy?
     The cash economy and the sharing economy, while not forms of tax evasion or fraud per
     se, have features that can facilitate tax crime. As such, the work that is being undertaken
     in this area can have a complementary impact on the effectiveness of the technology
     solutions described above.
     The features of the cash economy that can facilitate tax crime are that cash is fungible
     and untraceable. This makes it easier for under-reporting and falsification to occur as
     there is not necessarily a record trail as there might be when credit and debit cards and
     electronic funds transfers are used. The solutions identified above - using tamper proof
     data recording technology and requiring electronic invoicing - will work together to reduce
     the risks posed by the cash economy.
    What work is being undertaken to address the cash economy?
     Tax authorities are working on a range of solutions, including legislation, analytical tools
     and encouraging the use of cashless payments such as mobile phone payment methods.
       Box 3. Examples of other approaches to address the cash economy
       In Argentina, a partial reimbursement of VAT is offered for purchases of personal property or
       hiring of services when the final consumers perform the transaction using authorised credit card
       or bank transfers.
       In Austria, legislation provides that cash payments for services in the construction industry
       (including labour) exceeding EUR 500 are no longer tax deductible. The payments must be
       performed via bank transfer in order to claim the deduction, and this is auditable. Payments
       for wages for work in the construction sector must not be afforded or accepted in cash if the
       employee has a bank account or legitimate claim for one.
       In Finland, ATM withdrawals are monitored. Withdrawals are summarised by credit / debit card
       number and cardholders are identified by card number (domestic issued cards) or other means
       (cards issued abroad). A photograph is taken at the ATM to identify the person withdrawing
       the cash, and this is available to the tax authority through online connection. If necessary, the
       photograph will be used for identification purposes at a later stage and this can be used as a risk
       indicator and / or in conjunction with other information during an investigation.

"571","    THE CASH ECONOMY AND THE SHARING ECONOMY: COMPLEMENTARY WORK TO ADDRESS THE RISKS
              Box 3. Examples of other approaches to address the cash economy (continued)
              In France, limits are imposed prohibiting cash payments over EUR 1 000.
              In Greece, limits are imposed prohibiting cash payments over EUR 1 500.
              In Italy, restrictions on cash were put in place in the real estate sector. In order to obtain allowances
              for refurbishment expenses and for energy efficiency improvements to buildings, the payment
              must be performed through a bank or postal transfer. A withholding tax of 8% is also applied.
              This system reduces the risk of untraceable transactions but also has an immediate revenue
              impact.
              In Sweden, companies can refuse to accept cash payments. This approach is already being
              used by some restaurants, public transportation and hotels. In Sweden the use of cash is
              decreasing, and approximately 80 % of all transactions are made electronically, including through
              new techniques such as smartphones and contactless payment methods. An app developed
              by banks in Sweden facilitates money transfers between private persons and make payments
              to companies, which has increased in use from 76 000 transactions in 2012 to 76 million
              transactions in 2015.
         What are the challenges posed by the sharing economy?
            While the cash economy has long been considered by tax authorities, the sharing economy
            is a relatively new issue. A number of tax administrations have started to investigate the
            risks of tax evasion and fraud posed by the sharing economy. This includes businesses that
            operate online through community marketplaces, such as private renting of residential
            premises through sharing platforms such as Airbnb, driving services through online
            platforms such as Uber and professional selling through online platforms such as eBay.
            PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates that the sharing economy generates USD 15 billion in
            revenue around the world, and this this could grow to USD 335 billion by 2025.
            The challenge of the sharing economy that means it can facilitate tax fraud and evasion
            is that it can be more difficult to identify the existence of business activity. This is
            particularly true where the person is not registered as conducting a business or is in
            a foreign jurisdiction. However, the online nature of these platforms also presents an
            opportunity to deploy technology to tackle this.
         What work is being undertaken the sharing economy?
            Tax authorities are starting work in this area, including analytics, regulatory and policy
            considerations. In addition, legislative solutions and international co-operation amongst
            tax authorities is likely to be of assistance in this area, particularly where online platforms
            are located in jurisdictions other than the location of the customer. For example, the
            country in which an online platform is situated could introduce requirements that online
            platforms keep records of its users, which could be reported to the tax authority and
            exchanged internationally pursuant to information sharing agreements.
                                                                                                                        23

   Box 4. Examples of approaches to address the sharing economy
   Argentina has introduced a special registration system for VAT purposes. This applies to the
   operator of online portals used for sales operations of new personal property, and online portals
   where the hiring of services is agreed or performed electronically. The operator of the online
   portal is obliged to act as VAT collection agents in respect of the transactions performed through
   the online portal.
   Australia makes extensive use of third party data. The tax authority has access to information
   held in the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) which is Australia’s
   financial intelligence unit with regulatory responsibility for anti-money laundering and counter-
   terrorism financing. Through this information, it has traced funds flowing to drivers and renters
   from overseas to local banks from where they are distributed. The tax authority is using its
   powers to obtain data from these banks to identify unregistered business activity such as Uber
   drivers. So far it has been able to identify a large portion of drivers. In addition, the tax authority is
   working with the platform facilitators, Uber and Airbnb in particular, to have taxation information
   provided to their partners (i.e. drivers and letters of properties).
   Austria uses internet monitoring using different internet scraping tools (web harvesting or web
   data extraction), some of which are open source and others are custom-made tools. The
   results of this work feeds into compliance measures such as letters to presumptive taxpayers
   and information campaigns. Compliance efforts targeting foreign companies offering goods or
   services in Austria led to VAT collection of EUR 10 million, as well as 44 voluntary declarations
   resulting in collection of VAT of EUR 5.5 million.
   Belgium is using internet scraping and requesting all digital data to enable data mining with
   existing taxpayer files. This is used in conjunction with other analytics tools such as a ‘Forensic
   Toolkit’ to collect and cull data in a forensic inspired way; using Accounting Command Language
   to analyse semi-structured data which allows importing data from different accounting packages
   to create a ‘standard audit file’ and to perform some standard checks; and using an e-discovery
   solution Zylab to analyse unstructured data like e-mail and PDF documents to search and review
   this data.
   The province of Ontario in Canada is recognising the economic potential of the sharing economy
   by partnering with Airbnb to launch a new pilot project. Airbnb will educate its hosts through
   an email notification during tax season to remind them of their tax obligations. The province
   of Ontario and Airbnb have collaborated to create a webpage with content specific to Ontario
   regulations.
   Finland has legislation to enable the collection of third party information. In addition to audits
   to collect data to identify shared economy actors, legislation is now used to monitor online
   credit / debit card payments to detect unregistered remote sellers and VAT EU distance sellers.
   Data is filtered and clustered by using scripts. Where a significant volume of payments are
   identified as being made to an unknown person, this can be investigated to determine if the
   person is an unregistered business. To date, the tax authority has identified 188 unregistered
   distance sellers, amounting to sales of EUR 50 million. Based on sales, the estimated VAT loss
   is EUR 12 million yearly.

            Japan gathers and analyses information on information-providing services on the internet such
            as fee-charging websites to identify suspected online businesses, using a general search engine
            After picking up a specific suspicious company, comprehensive information is collected using
            internet crawlers which enable an exhaustive search on the internet. Thus, a variety of materials
            and information is collated in a database and matched against taxpayers in the system of the tax
            authority. This matching system enables the tax authority to visualise the risks for each taxpayer.
            The United Kingdom is using a product called COSAIN which automates the collation and filtering
            of social media and websites. The tool collates profiles, which can be used to monitor the trends
            within a geographic area or specific business sector. In future the e-commerce sector will be able
            to be analysed, such as collating data from sites such as Craigslist, eBay and Gumtree.

   Chapter 5
       Introducing technology tools: Best practice approaches
    The experience of tax administrations in introducing a technology solution shows that
    there are best practices that can assist in making the implementation swift and effective.
    First, as there are a variety of solutions available for any given problem, it is critical that
    the tax administration has clearly defined its objective. This includes careful identification
    of the problem that is being addressed, comparing the options available to it, investigating
    the technology solutions and preparing an implementation plan that is transparent to the
    taxpayers. It may also be helpful to seek the input of a range of government stakeholders,
    including policy, budgetary, tax, technical and legislative functions.
    Engagement and consultation with the taxpayers that will be affected is an important aspect
    of implementing a new solution. This can equip the tax administration with insights into
    the most cost effective solutions, the solutions that would be suitable for different types,
    maturity and sizes of businesses, provide an opportunity to resolve questions, provide
    guidance and identify if other supporting measures (such as incentives or enforcement
    measures) may be needed to bring about swift change. Framing this dialogue in a positive
    manner can be particularly effective, as although there may be costs for taxpayers there
    is an opportunity to present the benefits for taxpayers. This includes the importance of
    ensuring a level playing field between competitors, the ability to streamline other tax
    reporting obligations, and the ability to guard against reputational damage that arises
    from tax crimes.
    Collaboration with the private sector providers of the solutions from an early stage can
    be helpful if the market will be supplying the relevant technology solution, and market
    competition in this field can reduce the costs for taxpayers. Early engagement with the
    private sector can also assist the tax administration in learning the technical terminology
    and equipping it to accurately describe the required specifications. This can in turn
    ensure that the private sector understands how to meet the requirements. Engagement
    with the private sector can also assist in designing a solution that will be future proofed;
    for example, to ensure that any updates in software or improvements in the design
    are able to be implemented in a cost effective manner over time rather than requiring
    substantial and repeated investments. Testing prototypes of technology test or practical
    proof of concept evaluations can further support the development of relevant technology
    requirements and specifications, which ultimately facilitates efficient implementation.
    In some cases, tax administrations have adopted a pilot project approach. This approach
    can introduce the solution for an initial test period, such as in a particular region or a
    particular business sector which is at high risk of tax fraud and evasion, or introducing

"577","                       INTRODUCING TECHNOLOGY TOOLS: BEST PRACTICE APPROACHES
            it as a voluntary solution coupled with an incentive for businesses that participate in
            the pilot project. This can be helpful in identifying any implementation problems or
            unforeseen practical questions. Once any implementation problems have been resolved,
            the solution can be implemented more widely in industry sectors or locations which are
            the next priority in terms of risk.
            Harnessing the deterrent effect is also an important aspect. This can be done by efforts to
            raise the public awareness of the extent of the problem, which can mean that the public
            is an important advocate of change. This can be particularly helpful if legislative changes
            will be used to introduce a technology solution. Campaigns can be continued over time
            to publicise the results of technology solutions in recovering public revenue, as these
            boost taxpayer morale, reinforce the deterrent effect of these solutions and lend support
            to further expansion of the use of technology tools in preventing and detecting tax fraud.
            Enforcement efforts are also necessary to ensure the effective use of technology solutions.
            These act as a deterrent for businesses in avoiding or misusing the required technology
            solution as well as penalising any offenders. In addition to pecuniary penalties, other
            examples of penalties that are used include the suspension of a business licence, imposing
            a period of enhanced supervision by the tax authority, and public “naming and shaming”
            of non-compliant taxpayers. The public can also be encouraged to act as an enforcement
            mechanism where there is a whistleblowing mechanism, allowing employees or customers
            to inform the tax authority of suspected violations of tax obligations, and possibly offering
            a reward for doing so. In order to enforce the requirements, the tax authority will need a
            mechanism to detect and measure non‑compliance, including an ability to measure the
            correct functioning of a technology solution such as through certification.
            Finally, tax administrations should continue to engage with taxpayers, the private sector
            and with each other in order to stay abreast of new risks and share the gains made in
            implementing new solutions. Technology is a fast changing area, and criminals will
            continue to find new approaches that demand new response from tax authorities. Tax
            authorities should continue to share their experiences and insight in utilising technology
            to combat and deter tax evasion and tax fraud, as well as provide feedback into the
            broader reform efforts across the tax administration to improve tax compliance.

   Chapter 6        Conclusion
    The results that can be achieved by utilising technology to detect and prevent tax fraud
    and tax evasion speak for themselves. These solutions can offer a win-win: better detection
    of crime, higher revenue recovery, and synergies that can make tax compliance easier for
    business and tax administrations. This short report shows that in many cases working
    solutions are already in place, and that a number of countries are already able to share
    their experience in the implementation process. It is hoped that this brief report serves
    as an encouragement for all countries to consider the risks in their taxpayer segments,
    and to take advantage of the experience of others included in this report to leverage the
    lessons already learned.
    Technology tools are not a single fix to the problem of tax fraud and tax evasion, but
    if implemented effectively, substantial progress can be made in high risk areas. These
    solutions should always be accompanied by the other necessary tools available to tax
    authorities, including legislative measures, effective enforcement, taxpayer consultation
    and international co-operation.
    This report has focused on just a few areas where technology solutions are having a
    significant impact. As technology and taxpayer behaviour continues to evolve, further
    areas of work will become relevant. This could include further work on the sharing
    economy; carousel fraud; customs fraud. Any further work in this area could also build
    on the ongoing work in the field of data analytics undertaken by both the Task Force on
    Tax Crimes and Other Crimes and the Forum on Tax Administration.

                 Electronic cash registers / fiscal printers have been implemented in Argentina since the
                 late 1990s. In December 2013, the requirements were strengthened to incorporate new
                 technology with improved intelligence and security in response to evasion techniques that
                 emerged. The new equipment will generate electronic files of the transactions performed,
    Argentina    including a digital signature. The files will be regularly transmitted to the tax authority in a
                 similar mechanism as is used for the filing of tax returns.
                 For reference, see General Resolution N° 3561/13 AFIP, at www.infoleg.gov.ar.
                 The challenges that need to be considered in introducing the technology tools include:
                     • Limitation of the implementation by the taxpayers who are located in areas of the
                         country with low or no internet connectivity;
                     • Preference for paper procedures in some sectors (mainly small taxpayers or areas
                         within the country);
                     • Costs that have to be paid by the taxpayers for the adaptation of their invoice
                         systems and/or the acquisition of the equipment;
                     •  Need to detect possible mistakes in the development of taxpayers invoicing
                         systems early.
                 Technical features: Changes to the Austrian Federal Fiscal Code were introduced in two
                 tranches.
                 From 1 January 2016:
    Austria          • For every transaction a receipt has to be issued.
                     • Compulsory introduction of electronic cash registers or other electronic recording
                         systems for digital recording business cases and for printing receipts for all
                         businesses with annual turnover of more than EUR 15 000 provided that annual
                         cash turnover exceeds EUR 7 500.
                     • Each cash register must draw up a data collection log (DCL) to record and store
                         each individual cash transaction. The DCL has to be exportable without delay in
                         case of a request from the tax authorities.
                 From 1 April 2017:
                     • A secure signature creation device has to be implemented in the cash register.
                     • All receipts have to be signed.
                     • The cash register has to have a cumulative memory, meaning that the transactions
                         recorded in the cash register are added up continuously. The cumulative memory
                         is part of the signature and constitutes another measure for the prevention of
                         manipulation.
                     • The cash register has to print a monthly final zero-receipt with the level of the
                         cumulative memory and to store it in the DCL
                 Companies must acquire the required number of signature creation devices from a
                 certified service provider offering qualified signature certificates that is established in the
                 EU, EEA or in Switzerland. The recording-software of the cash register does not have to be
                 certified because the security mechanism consists of linking cash transactions using the
                 electronic signature of the signature creation device. The linking is formed in the signature
                 to be generated by including elements from the last assigned signature saved in the data
                 collection log. When recording the first cash sale, the cash register identification number
                 replaces the last assigned signature.

                        Enforcement: At the request of the tax authorities, the company must record a cash
                        transaction set to zero and hand over the receipt issued by the cash register for inspection
                        purpose. For cash registers with a device to transmit payment receipts electronically, the
                        receipt must be made available electronically. At the request of the tax authorities, the
                        company must export and hand over the DCL for a period specified by the tax authorities
                        to an external data carrier. The data carrier must be provided by the company.
                        There are penalties for manipulating cash registers, which apply both to the taxpayers as
                        well as the producers / software engineers of the electronic recording systems.
                        This solution has been beneficial as it offers technical accuracy, is low cost, and allows
                        efficient and effective management of controls and audits.
                        In 2014, Belgium introduced legislation for certified cash registers, designed to address
                        VAT fraud.
                        The solution consists of four important pillars: technical solution that secures data (making
                        tempering detectable); certification of the devices; registration of all devices by the different
            Belgium
                        stakeholders with the Ministry of Finance; and auditing on the field.
                        Technical features: The ‘Registered Cash Register System’ (RCRS) applies for the
                        hospitality sector. This RCRS always includes three ‘devices’:
                             1. the Electronic Cash Register / Point of Sale (ECR/POS) with regulation specifying
                                  the forbidden and mandatory functions;
                             2. the Fiscal Data Module (FDM) that stores the relevant data;
                             3. the VAT Signing Card (VSC) that contains two certificates to digitally sign the
                                  receipt.
                        When a transaction is registered in the ECR/POS, the relevant content is transmitted to
                        the FDM, where it is time stamped and stored and receives the digital signature. The data
                        includes updated counters from the VSC. Some of the control data is also printed on
                        the receipt, making signature verification possible. The digital encryption and signature
                        is very strong, since the Public Key Infrastructure pair of keys is individually created by
                        Belgium’s certification authorities in a safe Hardware Security Module environment which
                        is unknown to all other involved stakeholders (such as manufacturers of ECR/POS and
                        FDM and taxpayers).
                        Implementation: Both the ECR/POS and FDM are available on the market, but each
                        model must be certified by the Belgian Ministry of Finance’s fiscal department.
                        In addition to the certification, Belgium introduced a registration system. This allows the
                        Belgian Ministry of Finance to know exactly which taxpayers have what equipment, where
                        it is installed and from what time. Furthermore, each certified software has to be hashed,
                        which enables the Ministry of Finance to determine whether the installed system is a
                        correct clone of the certified model or not. The fiscal auditors will have an audit tool to both
                        analyse the FDM data and check the integrity of the data through automatic verification
                        of signatures.
                        The solution has been introduced in the hospitality sector. Originally this applied to
                        establishments with sales turnover of which at least 10 % consisted of meals to be
                        consumed in the premises. In future, the target group will be limited to the establishments
                        with a sales turnover of meals to be consumed in the premises that exceeds EUR 25 000.
                        Full implementation is ongoing and expected to be finished by the end of 2016.
                        Results: The initial results from comparing the declared sales turnover on meals in the
                        restaurants that installed the solution during 2015 with the sales turnover in 2014 shows
                        an increase in 8%. This is notwithstanding that 80% of the restaurants taken into account
                        in the 2015 sales results had only been using the solution for two months. There is also
                        some evidence to suggest a longer trend of increased sales turnover since 2010 of over
                        20% each year, possibly indicating a ‘whitening process’ even before the RCRS became
                        mandatory.
                                                                                                                          35

"584","            TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
               In the province of Quebec, the tax authority developed a Sales Recording Module (SRM).
               There are four aspects to this solution: (1) an obligation on the business to provide receipt;
               (2) the receipt has to be generated using the SRM; (3) inspection activities by the tax
               authority; and (4) a public awareness campaign.
   Canada
   (Quebec)    The legislative basis for the implementation was a modification of the Act respecting the
               Québec sales tax (CQLR, chapter T-0.1) and the Regulation respecting the Québec sales
               tax (CQLR, chapter T-0.1, r.2) as well as an amendment to the Tax Administration Act
               (CQLR, chapter A-6.002) to provide, among other things, for the imposition of penalties.
               Technical features: The SRM has three main functions. The SRM receives, registers and
               sends the transaction data from the point of sale / cash register to the receipt printer.
               The receipt produced by the SRM must notably contain the total amount of tax due
               from the transaction, the date and time of the invoice, information on the establishment
               providing restaurant services, a barcode and a unique digital signature which guarantees
               the authenticity of the document. The data generated by the SRM also results in the
               standardised creation of accounting records for all bars and restaurants, which is a
               significant administrative benefit for taxpayers. The SRM also produces sales summaries
               which can be sent to the tax authority on request.
               The tax authority identifies the specifications required in the point of sale / cash register
               in order to be compatible with the SRM, lists a number of compatible systems that meet
               them and can also issue certificates of compliance where an existing system has been
               adapted.
               Enforcement: Inspections are conducted through the use of hand held computers.
               Inspectors may attend a restaurant posing as an ordinary customer or in uniform identifying
               themselves and verify if a receipt is issued to them for the meal. The device can then
               read the barcode on the invoice. This validates the signature on the invoice and identifies
               whether the invoice was produced using the SRM. The inspector can retrieve information
               stored in the SRM by downloading it onto a USB key and compare the data from the SRM
               to the information otherwise reported by the taxpayer.
               The public awareness campaign consisted of launching a multimedia ad campaign in
               order to promote the new measures, thus informing the general public that the operator of
               a restaurant or bar is required to provide them with an SRM-generated bill, among other
               things.
               Implementation: The SRM was first implemented in the restaurant sector, as there
               was evidence of sales suppression in this industry. When implementation was launched,
               33 000 SRMs were installed in 20 000 establishments. The provincial government
               subsidised the purchase and installation of SRMs for a temporary period.
               Results: At 31 March 2016, CAD 1.2 billion (EUR 822 million) in taxes was recovered
               following the introduction of the SRM into the restaurant industry. Projections are that, by
               2018-2019, this will cumulatively amount to CAD 2.1 billion (EUR 1.44 billion).
               The SRM was then implemented in the bar sector as of 1 February 2016. At the time, tax
               losses were estimated at CAD 76 million (EUR 52 million) per year.
               The future plans include upgrading the solution and implementing it in taxi driving
               businesses.

"585","                CATALOGUE OF COUNTRY SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC SALES SUPPRESSION
                        Based on the Finnish Government’s Resolution on a National Strategy for Tackling the
                        Shadow Economy and Economic Crime for 2016–2020, an Action Plan against the
                        Shadow Economy and Economic Crime has been drawn up. The Action Plan is dated 7
                        June 2016 and comprises 20 projects, one of which is a study on the applicability of type-
            Finland     approved point-of-sale systems in Finland.
                        According to the project, the tax administration will prepare a study on the applicability of
                        type approved point of sale systems in Finland. The study will take into account technical
                        implementation, costs to the authorities and businesses as well as impact assessments.
                        Views on the study will be requested from business representatives as well as from other
                        stakeholders involved.
                        The purpose of type-approved point-of-sale systems is to ensure the recording of cash
                        transactions, prevent the manipulation of data by encryption methods and other technical
                        strategies, and ensure that the authorities performing supervision have access to data in
                        standardised form.
                        Because of the global trend, the study will focus on ‘online’ point-of-sale systems. The
                        study will be implemented by the end of 2018.
                        In order to fight against VAT fraud related to the use of fraudulent software, the Finance Bill
                        for 2016 establishes the obligation for merchants and other professionals subject to VAT
                        to use a secure and certified cash register system or accounting software.
                        As of 1 January 2018, the use of a secure system will have to be attested by a certificate
            France
                        issued by an accredited organisation or an attested by a certificate issued by the publisher.
                        In cases where there is no certification meeting the requirements, a penalty of EUR 7 500
                        per item of software will apply, and the offender will have to rectify the situation within 60
                        days.
                        It is anticipated that some merchants will be able to comply by updating their existing
                        software, as part of a maintenance contract purchased when buying the software.
                        Ensuring that digital records cannot be changed requires the introduction of legal provisions
                        as well as technical measures. For this reason, the new Act on the Protection of Digital
                        Records from Manipulation was implemented (Federal Law Gazette 2016 I page 3152).
                        The intention is that all taxpayers who use an electronic cash register (both cash registers
            Germany     and computer-based tills) will be required to protect the system by means of technical
                        security features.
                        The measures consist of the following elements:
                             1.  Mandatory use of technical security features in an electronic recording system.
                             2.  Introduction of cash register inspections.
                             3.  Sanctions against violations.
                        Technical security features: The technical features of electronic recording systems
                        include that it must consist of a security module, a storage medium and a digital
                        interface. The Federal Office for Information Security will specify and certify the technical
                        requirements for each of these components. The electronic basic records must be
                        recorded individually, completely, accurately, promptly, in consecutive order and in a way
                        that they are unchangeable. They must be saved on a storage medium and kept available.
                        These requirements will make it possible in the future for the direct subsequent verification
                        of individual transactions to take place.
                                                                                                                        37

"586","               TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
   Germany        A Technical Ordinance on the Implementation of the Act on the Protection of Digital Records
   (continued)    from Manipulation will describe the requirements for the logging of the individual electronic
                  records. Pursuant to the ordinance, a new transaction must be recorded simultaneously
                  as it occurs by the electronic recording system for every transaction or other operation.
                  This means the data is recorded and stored in a uniform process by means of which
                  the logged individual digital records cannot be manipulated after it has occurred. For
                  this reason, each transaction must be assigned the time of the start of the operation,
                  an unambiguous consecutive transaction number, the type of operation, the date of the
                  operation, the operation’s end time or the time when the operation was cancelled, and a
                  check value. If a manipulation should nevertheless occur, this can be detected at any time
                  by means of the transaction chain.
                  Inspections: Furthermore, unannounced cash register inspections will take place, in
                  order to ensure a significantly increased risk of detection for the taxpayer. Cash register
                  inspections will be used to verify conformity with the law, in particular the correct use of the
                  technical security features. An inspection can take place without advance notice and will
                  take the form of a special process aimed at promptly reviewing the correctness of the cash
                  register records and whether the cash register records have been correctly entered into
                  the accounts. In this context it is worth mentioning the digital interface, which will enable
                  the auditors from the revenue authorities to carry out the inspection more quickly, as well
                  as the option of more easily recognising whether the registration of the basic records is
                  complete by means of the issued receipts.
                  Sanctions: If violations of the new obligations regarding the proper use of the technical
                  security features are detected, then this can be punished as a tax-related administrative
                  offence with a fine of up to EUR 25 000, irrespective of whether any loss of tax revenue
                  has occurred. This is intended to achieve a general preventive deterrent effect.
                  Costs: It is anticipated that this solution would mean one-off compliance costs for industry
                  totalling approximately EUR 470 million for the procurement of new equipment and the
                  conversion of existing equipment, plus annual ongoing compliance costs of approximately
                  EUR 106 million, which comprises certification costs, personnel costs relating to helping
                  with inspections and ongoing costs for maintenance and support. These estimates are
                  based on the following calculations:
                      • Estimated 2.1 million devices affected.
                      • One-off procurement and installation costs of approximately EUR 224 per device
                           (EUR 470 million in total for industry). This includes the procurement of new
                           equipment (around EUR 193 per device, or EUR 405 million in total for industry)
                           and the retrofitting of existing equipment (around EUR 11 per device, or EUR
                           22.5 million in total for industry). According to estimates, around 411 000 devices
                           could be replaced and 1.7 million devices could be converted. The total cost also
                           includes an additional amount of around EUR 8 per device (or EUR 17 million in
                           total for industry) for the acquisition of the security module for the conversion plus
                           around EUR 12 per device (or EUR 26 million for industry in total) in personnel
                           costs for the conversion.
                      • A time burden of an average of 30 minutes per company and cash register inspection
                           would be placed on industry. This estimate takes into account that inspection per
                           company can be of different intensity and length. Based on the expected audit rate
                           of all companies, this results in annual personnel costs of around EUR 343 000.
                  An amount of EUR 50 per device per year was estimated for the purposes of maintenance
                  and support (e.g. updating the cash register software). This would result in total costs for
                  industry of EUR 105 million per annum.

                       for failure to do so. This was borne out of the work of a cross-agency committee, including
                       the ministry of finance, tax authority, attorney-general’s department and others to study
            Ghana      the problem, the technical options, the feasibility of a solution and cost / benefit analysis,
                       which then made a proposal to Cabinet for consideration.
                       Technical features: the device will be linked to a central point in the tax authority,
                       meaning transactions will be transmitted to the tax authority in encrypted form in real time.
                       The device is also expected to verify / detect input tax claims by taxpayers and possible
                       rejection of fraudulent ones. It is further expected to generate several management reports.
                       Enforcement: The data provided to the tax authority will be used to generate risk analysis
                       reports, which would identify unusual data to be used for compliance activities. Field audit
                       staff will perform a benchmark study at the start of implementation, which would be used
                       in future for compliance. This has been based on experience from some compliance
                       work performed in the past where field auditors were stationed in businesses such as
                       shops or offices over a period of time to record sales, and thereafter the taxpayers did not
                       subsequently report lower sales to the tax authority.
                       Benefits and costs: The committee established to study the feasibility of introducing the
                       device estimate conservatively that the introduction of the fiscal electronic device would
                       increase revenue mobilisation by 20%. It is also expected significantly improve taxpayer’s
                       record keeping and bring a substantial amount of the informal sector into the tax net. It is
                       also expected to reduce the cost of tax collection. For taxpayers, implementation of the
                       fiscal electronic device is expected to reduce record keeping costs for taxpayers, reduce
                       transaction errors, and assist with stock management and recording employee activity
                       and performance. It is estimated that the fiscal electronic device will cost USD 800 –
                       USD 1 500 (EUR 726 – USD 1 362). The government is considering ways to support
                       taxpayers in bearing this cost.
                       New legislation is planned, which regulates the product evaluation and authorisation of
                       point of sale machines, as well as the requirements for businesses to use approved point
                       of sale machines.
                       Product evaluation and authorisation: In order to be an approved point of sales machine,
            Greece
                       it must meet the required technical specifications. This device must contain a port for
                       sending its identification data online to the server of the tax authority. If approved, it is
                       authorised for sale in the Greek market, known as a Fiscal Electronic Device.
                       The process for approving a point of sales product is as follows. Every manufacturer or
                       importer of such machines must seek approval from a committee in the Department of
                       Fiscal Electronic Cash Registers and Systems which is part of the Ministry of Finance. The
                       application includes submission of a working sample of the fiscal model for evaluation and
                       test.
                       The committee is responsible for checking whether the machine meets the technical
                       specifications, in conjunction with expert evaluators in the National Technical University
                       of Athens.
                       Once a model has successfully passed all tests, the committee issues the applicant
                       with a unique license number for the specific model. This license number is included on
                       each receipt and affixed on the approved model. This enables any person to check the
                       lawfulness of a specific model by looking at the license number on the issued receipt.
                                                                                                                      39

"588","               TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
   Greece         Requirement for businesses: A business selling goods and services in return for cash
   (continued)    payments must have a Fiscal Electronic Device. Whichever device is used, the taxpayer
                  is obliged to print a receipt for each retail transaction and give it to the customer. Only
                  receipts issued by an approved model of Fiscal Electronic Device are considered as
                  official, legal receipts (see also information on electronic invoicing below). Exemptions may
                  apply in the Decision of the General Secretary of Public Revenue (1002/31.12.2014). The
                  taxpayer must keep a copy of each receipt in either a hard copy or electronic journal. If
                  kept in an electronic journal, this must also be signed at the end of each day.
                  At the end of each day, a report must be printed with the daily totals. These must be kept
                  for at least five years and must be presented to auditing authorities on request.
                  The daily report is verified as authentic through the use of a signature. The signature is
                  created upon final issue of the daily report and is registered as a special record in the
                  device memory, accompanied by the date and time and printed on a special daily record
                  signature slip. This slip is issued automatically without requiring the intervention of the
                  operator of the device. It is then stored electronically.
                  The device memory is protected in a special box, which is an integral part of the fiscal
                  electronic device and is sealed with a special material such that the removal of the memory
                  is impossible without destroying the cover of the device. The preservation of this data is
                  independent of any integrated or external power source. The memory is either built-in and
                  sealed inside of the device or installed as an external add-on.
                  All receipts issued by the Fiscal Electronic Device during the day from the issue of the
                  previous daily total report until the issue of the next daily total report are registered in an
                  electronic journal. Consideration is being given to constructing a mechanism for the data
                  with the digital signature for the transactions to be automatically transmitted to the tax
                  authority server. The transmission of this data is encrypted and after the decryption is only
                  accessible by relevant personnel in the tax authority and by the owner of Fiscal Electronic
                  Device.
                  Enforcement: These solutions are monitored and enforces as follows:
                       •   Legislation and regulations state that businesses providing goods or services
                            to retail customers are obliged to inform customers of their obligation to issue
                            receipts. Taxpayers may only claim a tax deduction with respect to the purchase if
                            it can be verified with a legal receipt, giving them an incentive to ensure they obtain
                            a receipt when they purchase goods.
                       • Random audits will be undertaken by tax authorities to check that customers
                            exiting the business have a legally issued receipt.
                       • Strict penalties are imposed for a breach of the legal obligations, including for
                            failure to maintain these records, distortion of fiscal devices, alteration of the data
                            or destruction or corruption of these records.
                  In 2014, Hungary introduced an online cash register.
                  Technical specifications: Regulation includes technical specifications for the cash
                  registers, the security requirements, the user identification process and rules on licensing
                  cash registers. The data is recorded in a Fiscal Control Unit (FCU) equipped with a
   Hungary
                  mechanical seal, which is embedded in the machine at the point of sales.
                  Data transmission: The data is then transmitted in high frequency to the tax authority.
                  Having regard to the need to ensure reliability, it was considered best to use mobile phone
                  network operators as they are identifiable and reliable service providers, and the mobile
                  network covers almost all of the country. To ensure confidentiality, bank-level cryptographic
                  solutions have been introduced, the infrastructure of which is provided by the tax authority.

"589","                 CATALOGUE OF COUNTRY SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC SALES SUPPRESSION
            Hungary      Implementation: The IT-solution was developed by market players based on published
            (continued)  criteria and a competitive tender from the market was launched. The system was first
                         introduced in the retail and hospitality sectors which had previously been obliged to use
                         (not on-line) cash registers as well, and in 2016 it was expanded to the service sector and
                         to car dealerships and car parts dealers. More than 225 000 cash registers are connected
                         to the system. In order to obtain the solution, small businesses receive subsidies for up to
                         five changes of cash machines.
                         Inspection: The tax authority has mobile inspection devices, from which display
                         operating cash registers on a map. Using these devices an inspector can directly access
                         the data of a particular taxpayer. The incoming data are stored in a data warehouse which
                         allows continuous risk assessment, analysis, and setting up a list of shops selected
                         for spot checks. The auditor can also verify whether the number and type of electronic
                         cash registers in a particular shop match the number and type registered in the central
                         database, as well as check whether the amount of money or money equivalent in the cash
                         register matches the amount recorded on the fiscal control unit.
                         Results: In the first year of introduction (2014), VAT revenue increased by 15% in the
                         concerned sectors, and as a result, the increase in VAT revenues has exceeded the overall
                         costs of the whole project already during the introduction. Since then, there has been a
                         continuous clearing of the economy in the concerned sectors. In addition, there was an
                         increase in the number of employees registered for tax.
                         To address the risk of data alteration using illegal sales suppression software, Italy
                         introduced Legislative Decree no. 127 dated 05.08.2015. The Decree is designed to
                         encourage the electronic transmission of payment data as well as the use of e-invoicing
                         (electronic documents undersigned with electronic signature). See below for more detail
            Italy        on electronic invoicing.
                         It applies to retailers, and introduces a cash register system directly transmitting data to
                         the tax authority at the end of each day, securely and without altering any information. In
                         this way, some accounting obligations are not due.
                         This measure is designed to:
                              • Boost the risk analysis.
                              • Simplify the system.
                              • Promote and support the digitalisation.
                         Kenya is currently testing a new solution, Accounting Command Language, I Tax
                         Management and electronic cash registers to address the problem of manipulation of sales
                         data, and non-reporting of sales transactions. These are focussed on the risks posed in
                         the construction sector, supermarkets and shopping malls and medium – large taxpayers.
            Kenya
                         Additional tax has been reported since tax transactions have been required to be
                         performed online such as tax return filling and payments. Audit and investigation modules
                         are at an advanced stage of being implemented.
                         In the Netherlands a “voluntary” quality-mark is developed.
                         Features: A cash register with a quality mark fulfils the requirements to store and process
                         data reliably, and whereby alternations to transactions can be detected. The set of quality
                         mark indicators were developed with inputs from many developers and distributors of
            Netherlands
                         cash registers.
                         Implementation: The Netherlands Tax and Customs Administration encourages the
                         implementation of these “quality-mark” point of sale-systems in the whole market. In
                         particular, it focussed on franchisors, which have an interest in preventing any harm to the
                         name and reputation of their business. The tax administration made an agreement with the
                         franchisees on checking doubtful returns based on EDP scripts. Any improbabilities were
                         shared with the franchisor and they were given the opportunity to explain the findings.
                                                                                                                      41

"590","               TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
   Netherlands    Results: The results of this were positive. Of 45% of the fraudulent franchisees, 85% came
   (continued)    to a voluntary agreement with the tax administration in order to restore the misconduct.
                  The profit from investigated supermarkets alone was around EUR 15 million, including
                  fraud cases and voluntary statements of franchisees. The publicity may have also had an
                  impact on these results.
                  Another aim was to establish a change in behaviour among franchises by creating an
                  atmosphere in which committing fraud was unacceptable. The has led to more governance
                  in the sector, more control mechanisms like new software tools, more transparency
                  between retail organisations and more discussion between supermarkets about audit
                  mechanisms and experiences.
                  Rwanda has introduced legislation and regulations requiring Value Added Tax (VAT)
                  registered taxpayers to buy and use and electronic billing machines (EBM).
                  Context of introduction of EBM:
   Rwanda              • Manual invoicing systems were paper based which are easily destroyable by fire,
                          water or any other disaster.
                       • Forgery of invoices resulting into unreported sales and undue VAT refund claims.
                       • Double sales invoice books (especial large, medium or small family owned
                          businesses).
                       • Cost and time taken during tax audits.
                       • Lack of transparency in the course of tax audits.
                  Legal framework: Law No 37/2012 Establishing Value Added Tax as modified and
                  complemented to date and Ministerial Order Nº 002/13/10/TC of 31/07/2013 on
                  Modalities of Use of Certified Electronic Billing Machine. For reference, the Ministerial
                  Order is available here: www.rra.gov.rw/typo3conf/ext/complete/Resources/Public//
                  download/pdf/ogazette.pdf
                  Technical features: There are two aspects of the system: a Certified Invoicing System
                  (CIS) and a Sales Data Controller (SDC), also available certified All in One device
                  incorporating CIS and SDC features in one device and certified software meeting CIS
                  requirements.
                  The CIS is the point of sale machine, which must send the transaction data to the SDC.
                  Each CIS has a unique registration number. The CIS must generate a receipt containing
                  at least the following data: taxpayer’s name; identification number; address where the sale
                  took place; receipt type and transaction type; serial number of the receipt in uninterrupted
                  ascending number series; description of the sale / service items with quantity, price and
                  other actions such as cancellation or corrections; total sale amount; tax rate; tax on the
                  sale; means of payment; SDC information including date and time stamp, sequential
                  receipt number, receipt signature and SDC identification number; data and time stamp by
                  CIS; machine registration code.
                  The SDC is connected to the CIS and processes and stores the receipts. The SDC is
                  secure and tamper-proof, and each certified SDC has a unique serial number. The SDC
                  assigns an electronic signature to the transaction which is printed on the receipt. The
                  signature is verifiable by the tax authority using a special decryption tool which is unique for
                  every installed SDC device, meaning that falsification of the signature can be immediately
                  detected.
                  The electronic billing machine must be clearly visible to customers, with a statement
                  including the name of the user, the unique identification numbers for the CIS and SDC,
                  and that customers should not pay if a receipt is not issued. The electronic billing machine
                  must be connected to the tax authority’s server accessible to both the customs and
                  domestic tax officials. Data is transmitted in encrypted form. The tax authority can then
                  perform local audit or remote audit.

"591","                CATALOGUE OF COUNTRY SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC SALES SUPPRESSION
            Rwanda      Implementation: Implementation of the electronic billing machine requirements is
            (continued) occurring in a progressive manner, with the tax authority specifying particular categories
                        of taxpayers required to use electronic billing machines. Once fully implemented, every
                        business registered for VAT will have to provide a customer with a special receipt issued
                        through the electronic billing machine for every sold good or service.
                        The suppliers of electronic billing machines must obtain authorisation from the tax authority
                        in order to obtain certification of their systems. This includes a test of the software through
                        a live demonstration or machine inspection. Once certified, the supplier is added to the list
                        of certified products which is published on the tax authority’s website. Taxpayers will either
                        procure the electronic billing machine from the list of certified suppliers, or if they choose
                        to modify their existing system, this must be specifically inspected and authorised by the
                        tax authority as meeting the requirements.

   (continued)
                       • Low culture of invoice requesting whenever a sale is made.
                       • EBM users not issuing EBM invoices (they issue manual invoices, delivery notes or
                           simply nothing) especially in service industry such as in Restaurants, Bars but also
                           in Supermarkets.
                       • EBM users issue an invoice with the price lower than the actual money received.
                       • Misuse of tax rates (taxable goods considered as exempted ones).
                  Enforcement: Each taxpayer that is required to use an electronic billing machine must
                  register with the tax authority. The tax authority has the power to conduct inspections of
                  electronic billing machines to verify compliance with the technical specifications and other
                  taxpayer obligations with respect to the electronic billing machine. Substantial fines will
                  apply to businesses that do not install and use the electronic billing machine as required,
                  and to suppliers of CIS or SDC machines.

                  Electronic cash registers were introduced in the Slovak Republic in 2008. The legislation
                  with effect from 1 January 2015 extended the list of service providers who must use
                  electronic cash registers (“ECR”) when selling goods and services and also created a
                  virtual electronic cash register (“VECR”).
   Slovak
                  Technical features: The VECR is a platform set up on the Financial Directorate’s website
   Republic
                  and communicates with devices such as PC, tablet or smartphone and a printer. The
                  Financial Directorate developed the VECR application and made it available free of charge
                  for all the entrepreneurs that are obliged to use cash registers.
                  Compared to a receipt issued by the ECR, the receipt issued by the VECR contains
                  a unique identification code and QR code with all the data of issued receipt but also
                  identification data about the entrepreneur: business name of entrepreneur, billing address,
                  address of the sales point, tax identification number, and VAT identification number.
                  Access for the tax administration: All the financial transactions made by the seller are
                  saved on the Financial Directorate’s servers and are accessible to the tax administration.
                  Tax auditors can immediately access information about all the users such as the location
                  of the sales points, the issued receipts (fiscal receipts), the other receipts (non-fiscal
                  receipts), the amount of money in the VECR´s cash drawer and they can generate financial
                  closing accounts or reports including financial data regarding to a specific VECR user and
                  a specific time interval.
                  All the reports generated by the tax auditors are easily processable with analytical software
                  like IDEA from their desk. Tax auditors can run analytical tests over the reports and can
                  gain exact knowledge about the entrepreneur’s fiscal behaviour and detect risky fiscal
                  transactions (e.g. issuing lots of non-fiscal receipts, issuing receipts with returned items
                  which are reducing the tax duty). Using the data from VECR and analytical tools such as
                  IDEA can contribute to a more effective selection of sellers for later auditing.

            Slovak      Third party verification: The QR code can be easily checked by another application
            Republic    developed by the Financial Directorate named “Check the receipt”, an application designed
            (continued) for the customers or clients so they can verify themselves the data contained in the receipt
                        issued with the VECR. If customers or clients find that the data on the issued receipt does
                        not match the data on the VECR server, they can contact the Financial administration.
                        Next steps: The Financial Directorate is working on another application which will be used
                        by the tax auditors on the premises where the tax audit takes place. This new application
                        will be connected to the VECR server and will provide tax auditors with on-line and on site
                        information about the fiscal behaviour of the entrepreneurs, the issued receipts and allow
                        them to generate financial closing reports.
                        This new application should help the tax auditors to audit and control service providers
                        even more efficiently.
                        Sweden requires that sales must be registered in a cash register connected to a fiscal
                        control unit.
                        Technical features: The cash register must meet a certain standard, which the
                        manufacturers of the cash register are responsible for meeting. The fiscal control unit must
            Sweden
                        be certified by a specific body in the Swedish tax authority. Taxpayers must register with the
                        tax authority to confirm that they are using a cash register connected to a fiscal control unit.
                        The requirements for the content of the data that must be recorded in the fiscal control unit
                        are included in regulations. This includes:
                             • One log for counters: The total number of receipts issued, missing receipts, the
                                 number of regular receipts, the number of training receipts, the number of copies
                                 of receipts, the total sales and the grand total.
                             • Another log for specific information about each receipt: receipt number, date, time,
                                sales amount, VAT amount, and a unique control code generated by the control unit.
                        The information in the control unit is encrypted and can only be read and decrypted by
                        the Swedish tax authority.
                        Implementation: Sweden targeted all sectors that are selling goods and services which
                        are often paid in cash. Some general exemptions apply, including for taxis, e-commerce,
                        vending machines, amusements games, slot machines, and governmental or municipal
                        organisations. It is also possible for taxpayers to apply for an exemption, where the
                        bookkeeping is reliable and that the fiscal control can be guaranteed in other ways than
                        using a control unit; or if it is unreasonable for any reasons to have a certified cash register.
                        The cost for implementation was in average about EUR 2 500 per cash register, including
                        hardware and installations costs.
                        Enforcement: The tax authority analyses information from the electronic journal and from
                        the control unit using traditional e-audit methods. In addition, the tax authority conducts
                        a lot of unannounced on sight inspections to verify whether receipts are given and that
                        sales are registered, as well as doing undercover purchases posing as customers and
                        counting customers. Penalties can be issued if a sale is not registered. The information
                        from the inspections is then used as feedback to determine risk levels for follow up action.
                        The visibility of enforcement actions has been crucial for acceptance of the legislation and
                        compliance, as well as ensuring a level playing field between businesses.
                        Results: Compliance has increased both among users of cash registers and the
                        manufacturers of cash registers. Manufacturers are more compliant and the tax authority
                        has not found any zappers or phantomware since the legislation was implemented.
                        The immediate revenue effect once the requirements were introduced was a 5% increase
                        in the reported revenues. The estimation of the ongoing effect will be at least a 1% increase
                        in reported revenue. This means that the reform has resulted in increased tax revenues of
                        at least SEK 3 billion (EUR 320 million) per annum as a result of reduced tax evasion. In
                        addition, the introduction of the fiscal control unit has had a significant preventative effect
                        which has also contributed to increased revenue collection.
                                                                                                                          45

   Annex B
      Catalogue of country solutions for electronic invoicing
                 Argentina has used mandatory electronic invoicing for certain sectors since 2007 (and
                 optional electronic invoicing since 2006). Since then, the use of the electronic invoices
                 has been expanded in a gradual and phased manner according to the business activity
                 and type of taxpayer. During 2016, the implementation will be completed so that it will be
    Argentina    mandatory for all taxpayers registered for Value Added Tax (VAT).
                 Technical features: The model is based on the “online” authorisation of the documents.
                 This means that the taxpayer, after the approval of the operation, has to apply to the
                 tax authority for authorisation so that the document is considered an invoice and has
                 fiscal effects against third parties. The information is validated online and if the invoice is
                 authorised it is given an authorisation code and all the information entered is kept in the
                 database of the tax authority. In this way, the revenue body has the information of the
                 issuer and receiver of the invoice, of the applicable tax debit and the possible tax credit to
                 compute before the submission of the VAT return.
                 For more details see General Resolution N° 2485/08 AFIP www.infoleg.gov.ar and
                 www.afip.gob.ar/fe/#que.
                 Benefits: The implementation of digital documents has had the following advantages and
                 strengths (also relevant for electronic sales suppression above):
                     • There is a formal control at the moment of authorising the printing of receipts.
                     • The tax authority has timely access to the tax debit and possible calculation of tax
                         credit of the transactions.
                     • The digitalisation of the information, together with technological developments,
                         allow for the exploitation of large volumes of data more dynamically.
                     • They place the obligation on the taxpayer to comply with the procedures and
                         include the data in the making of the receipts in accordance with the existing rules,
                         reducing the administrative cost for the tax authority.
                     • Once the transaction is registered, the possibility of it being subsequently falsified
                         is significantly reduced as the invalidation of a receipt may only take place with
                         a new document adjusting the previous one, leaving a record of the change, or
                         through a fraudulent manoeuvre that violates security standards in the electronic
                         cash register.
                     • There is an increased risk perception on the part of business and customers
                         because the information in electronic format and there are tools for third parties to
                         verify receipts.
                 Enforcement: Electronic invoicing is monitored and enforced as follows.
                     • There is a tool designed to verify receipts, whereby the receiver of the electronic
                         invoice, or entities dealing with tax/social security procedures, are able to verify if
                         the information contained in the receipt matches the information timely entered and
                         authorised by the tax authority. The online authorisation model provides an almost
                         immediate response to taxpayers has proved to be very productive from its early
                         stages in 2006 and has assisted progress with the generalised implementation of
                         the electronic invoice system to more sectors and taxpayers.
                     • The information on invoices received through the authorisation process provides
                         valuable information to perform cross-checking with other data recorded by the
                         tax authority.

                            turn generate risk perception by the taxpayers.
                       • In addition, although many of the measures are preventive, ongoing control is required
                            to maintain the risk perception levels. It is also necessary to periodically define new

                       have generated positive effects in a gradual, phased manner, together with the progress
                       of its implementation during the last 10 years. To date, there are more than 750 000 users
                       already incorporated in the system and more than 4 billion electronic receipts have been
                       issued.
                       Greece is in the process of introducing electronic invoicing requirements.
                       Technical features: All invoices, credit notes and consignment notes issued by computers
                       will be required to be signed electronically using a special licensed fiscal electronic signature
                       device (FESD). Each relevant business will be required to buy an approved FESD or adapt
            Greece
                       the existing computer equipment to meet the technical specifications. This is one of the
                       methods of authentication under the L.4308/2014.
                       When the invoice is printed, the unique e-signature generated by the FESD is printed
                       at the end of the document. This works as follows. After entering and formatting the
                       data to be printed in the computer, and after initialisation of the record issuing – printing,
                       the computer’s software saves, communicates and transmits to the FESD the set of the
                       required data of the slip being issued. The FESD receives this data, processes it with a
                       special security algorithm (SHA-1) that creates a hash value (sign) and sends the result
                       of this processing back to the connected computer. The hash value, which represents
                       a sequence of characters and digits, is the unique electronic digital “fingerprint” of the
                       data of the slip being issued. The FESD saves this hash value into his own working daily
                       memory and issues a relevant slip – receipt with the date, the time, the daily ascending
                       sequential number and the general ascending sequential number of slip issue.
                       All the produced signatures are stored securely the inside FESD’s memory at the end of
                       each day and collated in a day-end report. The day-end summary report is also assigned
                       a unique e-signature and saved permanently in the secure fiscal memory of the FESD.
                       These must be preserved for at least five years and provided to tax auditors in an audit.
                       These files are considered as primary transactional data and must be reflected to the
                       totals in accounting books.
                       Each day the business owner automatically sends the summary file to the tax authority
                       server, in encrypted form to be decrypted automatically only by the server. The fiscal data
                       are accessible by the owner of FESD and by the authorised personnel of the tax authority.
                       Benefits: The validity and integrity of those files are checked using an algorithm. It
                       takes approximately two minutes to check 150 000 invoices stored on a CD, running an
                       application on a typical laptop.
                                                                                                                         49

"598","          TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
             Italy first introduced an obligation from early 2014 for electronic invoicing for the supplies
             to the public sector. Electronic invoices are the only type of invoice that will be accepted
             by the public sector bodies procuring supplies.
             Technical features: The supplier must use the transmission channel identified by the
   Italy
             tax authority (the Exchange System) for transmitting the invoices to the tax authority. The
             electronic invoicing has the following characteristics:
                  • The content is structured in an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) file. This format
                       is the only one accepted by the Exchange System.
                  • The authenticity of origin and the integrity of the content are guaranteed by the
                       person who issues the invoice by affixing a certified electronic signature or a digital
                       signature.
                  • The transmission is conditional on the presence of the unique identification code of
                       the office to which the invoice is addressed, and which can be found in the Index
                       of Public Administrations.
             Expanded implementation: Electronic invoicing is now being expanded for use in
             transactions between private businesses. Legislative Decree no. 127 of 5 August 2015
             introduced measures for the electronic transmission of data on VAT transactions to the
             Revenue Agency. For transactions carried out as from 1 January 2017, taxpayers that
             supply goods and retail services (pursuant to Article 22 of Presidential Decree no. 633
             dated 26.10.1972) may choose between:
                  • Supplying information to the Revenue Agency in a more manual fashion, including
                       customers and suppliers lists, black list transactions, summary statements for
                       intra-EU acquisitions of goods and services; or
                  •   Transmitting electronically to the Revenue Agency all the invoices issued and
                       received without any other communication obligations.
             The tax authority is making software available to businesses for free from July 2016 to
             conduct electronic invoicing in business to business transactions enable the operators
             (especially the micro-small enterprises) to issue, transmit and store the electronic invoices.
             Results: In the first implementation period of June 2014 – February 2015, 2 672 780
             invoices were received. The tax authority is enhancing the processes to cross-check
             data, such as domestic supplier and customer listings which allow crosschecking of data
             submitted by domestic suppliers and customers so that potential tax gaps and losses can
             be intercepted. The electronic storage and linked transmission of the payment data will
             replace the obligation of fiscal certifications of the payments through the issuance of fiscal
             or cash register receipts.
             The widespread adoption of the electronic invoicing and data transmission tools, besides
             resulting in substantial reductions of the compliance procedures for taxpayers, will greatly
             enhance the detection and prevention of tax evasion, since the information available to the
             tax authority will allow it to carry out more precise risk analyses, through the execution of
             verifications and data cross-checks in an automatic and timely manner.
             Kenya is using Accounting Command Language to manipulate data and to check repeated
             invoices and skipped invoices. The focus is on all taxpayers, but medium – large taxpayers
             in particular. Although there have been some initial challenges in using the tool, the results
             have shown that where it is used regularly, the result has been very positive.
   Kenya
             Mexico introduced electronic invoicing in several stages.
             Prior to its introduction, taxpayers used only printed invoices, which were freely prepared
             and printed without tax administration controls. The disadvantages were that there was
             a high volume of false transactions using fake invoices to claim tax deductions and
   Mexico
             reduce tax; a high volume of hidden income in cases where no invoice was issued; and
             compliance action by the tax authority required manual checking.

"599","                      CATALOGUE OF COUNTRY SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC INVOICING
            Mexico        The first stage: Establishing controls
            (continued)
                          A requirement was introduced such that only authorised printers could produce invoices.
                          All invoices were required to have a unique number which was controlled by the tax
                          authorities and the authorised invoice number had to be linked to an updated taxpayer
                          register. The printer produced reports of the invoice numbers that were issued.
                          The results of this stage indicated that the authorised printers increased taxpayers’
                          perceptions of risk. However, a black market of “cloned” invoices emerged which were
                          produced by the authorised printers. A cloned invoice had a real folio number, but
                          contained false amounts and false clients. Because of this, the tax authority could not
                          check the operations of all authorised printers.
                          The second stage: from 1990s
                          The tax authority focussed on making intensive use of new technologies. This included the
                          use of digital advanced signatures; internet services; standardised electronic documents;
                          and enhanced data analysis.
                          The result: this led to the creation of the first electronic invoice (e-invoice), referred to as
                          “CFD”.
                          Third stage: from 2005
                          The standardised e-invoice contained the folio number which was controlled by the tax
                          authority as well as the taxpayer’s digital seal. The tax authority received monthly folio
                          reports. The e-invoices used XML (eXtensible Markup Language) tags, as it ensured easier
                          electronic data exchange and thus allowed compliance with the technological standard to
                          be an automated process.
                          At first, the use of e-invoices was optional for taxpayers. The use of e-invoices was then
                          made mandatory for larger corporations. The taxpayer either devised their own systems
                          to create the e-invoice or used the services of a provider.
                          The result: the number of false invoices was reduced. Larger taxpayers took advantage
                          of the standardised electronic XML documents in their broader record keeping and
                          administrative process and pushed their providers to use e-invoices. Technology
                          companies started developing software to use and manage data from e-invoices.
                          Some problems remained. Some issuers did not comply with the obligation to submit
                          monthly folio reports to the tax authority. The implementation cost was an obstacle for
                          adopting the e-invoice for some taxpayers and some taxpayers preferred to continue
                          using printer invoices.
                          Fourth stage: enhancing the e-invoices from 2011
                          Enhancements were made in order to ensure the best data use of e-invoices and make
                          their issuance by taxpayers easier. E-invoicing would work as follows. This resulted in a
                          134% increase in the number of e-invoices issued from 2010 to 2011.
                          Step 1: The customer requests a fiscal receipt from the vendor, who generates the
                          e-invoice and digitally stamps it according to the standards.
                          Step 2: The vendor sends the e-invoice to an Authorized Certification Service Provider
                          (PAC). The PAC is a trusted third party authorised by the tax authority.
                          Step 3: The PAC validates the structure, syntax and tax attributes of the e-invoice. If it is
                          valid, the PAC digitally stamps it with the folio number on behalf of the tax authority. The
                          folio numbers were assigned online by the tax authority to the authorised certification
                          service providers. The PAC also sends a copy of all invoices to the tax authority in real
                          time in XML format.
                          Step 4: The PAC returns the validated e-invoice to the vendor, who then sends it to its
                          customer by converting it from XML to PDF format.
                          Step 5: Both the customer and vendor can verify the authenticity of e-invoices.
                                                                                                                           51

"600","               TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD
   Mexico         Results: The only kind of invoice in Mexico is now e-invoice by internet. The use of
   (continued)    e-invoicing has been expanded for use in payroll. A similar format and standardisation is
                  also being used to document withholding tax and payments for dividends, trust operations,
                  derivatives, payments abroad and electronic accounting reports.
                  As at September 2014, there were 3 837 876 issuers of electronic invoices, and since
                  introduction almost 13.5 billion e-invoices had been issued. Mandatory electronic invoicing
                  in Mexico brought 4.2 million micro businesses into the formal economy.
                  In 2003, the VAT anti-counterfeit tax control system was introduced throughout China,
                  covering all the general taxpayers. In 2014, the VAT invoice processing system was
                  upgraded, and was rolled out step by step by the State Administration of Taxation of China
                  (SAT) from 1 Jan 2015, applicable to both general taxpayers and small scaled taxpayers
   The People’s   above a de minimus threshold.
   Republic of
                  Technical features: The new VAT invoice processing system boasts of collecting
   China
                  comprehensive VAT invoice data, including name of taxpayers, name and code of goods
                  (services), price, quantity, tax base, tax rate and amount of tax payable, etc. Taxpayers
                  upload the encrypted VAT invoice data into the database of tax administrations via internet,
                  each invoice with a digitally signed certificate. The invoice data is transmitted in a real-time
                  fashion fully monitored by tax administrations, and then classified and sent to receiver
                  taxpayers as the basis of tax filing, verification of the invoice authenticity, revenue source
                  management as well as data analysis and utilisation.
                  Benefits: When a taxpayer files a tax return, the new VAT invoice processing system
                  will automatically cross-check the data of both input tax and output tax against those in
                  the invoice database of tax administrations to prevent against under-reporting of the tax
                  payable or over claim of the input tax. Moreover, combining the VAT invoice data with the
                  tax return information, tax administrations across the country can also conduct tax risk
                  analysis and economy-taxation correlation analysis, with a view to detecting potential tax
                  risks and providing inputs for economic decision-making.
                  To sum up, with a broad prospect of application, the electronic data of VAT invoices will
                  play a positive role in standardising tax administration, preventing and controlling tax risks,
                  and conducting economic performance analysis.
                  Singapore has implemented a cross referencing system to detect incorrect Goods and
                  Services Tax (GST) information.
                  Technical features: This system captures sales and purchase transaction listings which
                  are requested from GST taxpayers through routine audits. The listing of information
   Singapore
                  provided is determined by the scope of the audit and would be complete in relation to the
                  scope of the audit. A standard data format is prescribed by the tax authority for taxpayers
                  under audit to submit sales and purchase listings. The standard format is in Microsoft
                  Excel.
                  Benefits: These transactions are then cross referenced with transactions submitted in the
                  past to uncover discrepancies. There are three main purposes for the cross-referencing
                  system:
                       • For the tax authority to match transactions in the sales / purchase listings obtained
                          from the audited taxpayer against any existing transactions listings in the database
                          (using the same supplier/customer ID and invoice number);
                       • For the tax authority to carry out third party confirmation for selected transactions
                          that are “unmatched” in the database to verify if the claims are in order;
                       • For the tax authority to identify the network of entities that have substantial
                          transactions with each other and the flow of such transactions - particularly in
                          suspected fraud cases - to all GST taxpayers across all industries.

            Singapore     The data is uploaded into a database system. The system will then enable auditors to cross
            (continued)   reference transactions which have been submitted previously to uncover discrepancies.
                          Periodically, certain transactions will also be selected to be sent to the businesses’
                          suppliers and customers for third party confirmation.
                          Results: The main strength is to maximise the benefits of existing audit processes by
                          making available collected data for use in future audit cases. In addition, the tax authority’s
                          compliance strategy subjects high risk industries and taxpayers to more frequent audits –
                          hence, the system will have more transaction data for high risks taxpayers.
                          Challenges: The main weakness of the system is that it does not have full coverage of
                          transactions, as data submission is triggered only when an audit is carried out. The tax
                          authority may, in the future, consider exploring e invoicing with 100% coverage of GST
                          taxpayers.

                          contains all types of transactions (input supplies, output supplies, and electronic cash
                          register receipts). Each transaction in the VAT control statement is identified by VAT
                          number of the supplier and the VAT number of purchaser, with the number of the invoice,
                          date and value.
                          Benefits: Automatic cross-checking of data provided by the supplier and the purchaser
                          in the VAT control statements (and combined with information from other sources on risk
                          factors) allows us to detect:
                              • carousel fraud and chain fraud;
                              • issued invoices that later on are not recorded in the accounting;
                              • varying of accounting;
                              • replacement of invoices in the accounting;
                              • not-issued invoices;
                              • not using electronic cash registers;
                              • non-taxable persons issuing the invoice with tax included;
                              • taxable persons that applied twice for tax deduction from the same invoice in two
                                  different taxable periods.
                          Results: During the years 2014 and 2015, amount of risky VAT detected in domestic
                          chain frauds was more than EUR 500 million.
                              • Effective planning of tax audit and performance – elimination of a human factor
                                  failure in auditing taxpayers, exactly specified set of questions derived from the
                                  retrieved data and its evaluation, when dealing with tax audit.
                              • Encouragement of voluntary compliance.
                              • Early awareness on tax fraud, its new trends and the territorial determination.
                                                                                                                          53

                      ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT
            The OECD is a unique forum where governments work together to address the economic,
            social and environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the forefront
            of efforts to understand and to help governments respond to new developments and
            concerns, such as corporate governance, the information economy and the challenges
            of an ageing population. The Organisation provides a setting where governments can
            compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practice
            and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies.
            The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the Czech
            Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland,
            Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
            Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the
            United Kingdom and the United States. The European Commission takes part in the work
            of the OECD.
            OECD Publishing disseminates widely the results of the Organisation’s statistics gathering
            and research on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as the conventions,
            guidelines and standards agreed by its members.
